Text: Hi,

I would like to know how to append parameters to kirby url() object...

Plus I have difficulties retrieving parameters with Params() as explained in article "The mighty mighty uri"
http://getkirby.com/blog/the-mighty-mighty-uri-object

Does "url rewrite" need to be set to "true" in the config file for this to work?

Any other example or information on the subject would be appreciated.

Thank you,

Thomas
