Text: Strangely enough it does not work for me.

I just put the following line in my default template :
<?php echo param('img') ?>

at the url "http://localhost:8888/kirby/img:image" 
-> I get "File not found"
at the url "http://localhost:8888/kirby/index.php?img:image
-> No param is printed for the following code "<?php echo param('img') ?>"

Same thing on my host server.

I wonder if there are any known issues... or other tests I could do.

Thank you,

Thomas
