Text: I started by using the tutorial on the site on using fields but then ran into trouble when i needed a field that ran over several lines

Is the '----' separator a Kirby thing or is it yaml, or maRkdown ? 

If I have a yaml field that spans multiple lines , do I have to use '|'? Why don't I need to use that for eg. Text: ... ?

Thanks

UPDATE. I get it now :-:-) 
The content of a file is a repeating set of
   label:
      stuff 
   Separator

And that is a Kirby convention using four dashes as the separator

Each bit of 'stuff' is passed to the template through a 'label' method which can then be parsed any way you like ... So for my initial problem it looks like I should use yaml's '|' convention for multi  line  fields
