Text: I have a question about how to activate a .css file that is different from the main .css (in some lines) and bind with **content/01-news** folder
Actually If the name of the txt. document is **news.txt** I can bind it with **news.php** from the **/site/templates** folder, but how can I definite another .css for the **news.php** ?? Any suggestion??
