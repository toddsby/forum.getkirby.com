    $articles->pagination()->nextPageURL() 

Is it possible to create a relative URL with this because I think I may be able to do it by just throwing in a hash symbol in front?

e.g.

    <a class="r-arrow" href="#<?php echo $articles->pagination()->nextPageURL() ?>"></a>

but I get this as a result

    <a href="http://mysite.com/articles/#http://mysite.com/articles/page:2
