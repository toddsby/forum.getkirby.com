Text: Yeah, the issue here is that the panel blueprint creates all fields, even empty ones. So when you're checking a field, you have to check what's in it, not whether or not it exists.

If you're not using the panel, then you can use your previous method because you're not going to stick empty fields in the text file yourself usually.
