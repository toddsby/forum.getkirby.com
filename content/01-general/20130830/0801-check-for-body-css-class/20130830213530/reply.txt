Text: Thanks, its a long story, but basically I am assigning a class to the body element based on the time of day via javascript so that I can style the site from daylight to nighttime. I cant seem to find any solution with Google/Stack Overflow but was thinking maybe someone had an idea that would do something like the below in a Kirby template file:

< php if($page-> ***HAS CLASS*** = 'day'): >
HTML code for day time
< php else: >
HTML code for night time
< php endif  >
