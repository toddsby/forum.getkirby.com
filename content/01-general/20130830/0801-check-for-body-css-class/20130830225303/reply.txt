Text: Of course if you do this all via PHP, you end up using your server time. Instead, you could do everything via javascript, and then you'll have the user's time.

Depending on what you want to do, you may not even need different HTML for day vs night. If you just want different styles, then you can do the following:

1. Apply the body class via javascript.
2. Use the class in your CSS for anything that needs to be different between day/night.
