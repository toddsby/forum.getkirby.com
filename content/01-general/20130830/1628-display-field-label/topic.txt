Text: I have looked around for an answer to this question, without success.

I have my panel blueprint set up as follows:

	question1:
		label: What is the meaning of life?
		type: textarea
		size: small

And here is the structure in my template file:

	<div id="question1">
		<div id="question">
		</div>
		<div id="answer">
			<?php echo kirbytext($regisseur->question1()) ?>
		</div>
	</div>

I have no problem displaying the value of the question1-field, but what I also want to display is the question itself, i.e. the 'label'. I was thinking of something along these lines (see below), but that would be too easy, I guess :)

	<div id="question1">
		<div id="question">
			<?php echo kirbytext($regisseur->question1($label)) ?>
		</div>
		<div id="answer">
			<?php echo kirbytext($regisseur->question1()) ?>
		</div>
	</div>

Thanks!
