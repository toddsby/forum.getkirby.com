Text: Thanks for your speedy response! As far as PHP code in a blueprint file there could be a number of benefits. For example, since you define select (drop-down) options in there it would be great to be able to have that populated dynamically. In my case, I'd like to use PHP to dynamically generate a drop-down of all the employees here at my work.

As far as PHP in the page content, I'm referring to be able to place code directly within the text of a page. Something like PHP echo "Hello World!"

I'm realizing that snippets could be the way to do this, however, I'd still like to know if straight up PHP is possible.

Thanks again for taking the time to respond.
