Text: Hello there!

I am trying to install the new panel for kirby 2 (<https://github.com/kirbycms/panel>)

But it does not seem to work properly! IS it because I need the new core? If yes, I already added the latest core (<https://github.com/kirbycms/core>) on the default pack (<https://github.com/kirbycms/default-pack>)

thank you,
Catherine
