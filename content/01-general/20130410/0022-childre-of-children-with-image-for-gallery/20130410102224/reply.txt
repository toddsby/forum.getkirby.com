Text: Thx for the quick reply.

I try to us $page->children()->children(), it works to get into the children of children and show the content of them with the title of each sub-subfolder that's perfect. But it doesn't take in count the subfolder1 title. I'd like to have something like this:
```
main folder > as a menu item
  subfolder1 -> as a submenuitem1 * does not appear*
       sub-subfolder1 -> as a title and beneath the images.  *work properly*
          img1
          img2
          img3
       sub-subfolder2 -> as a title and beneath the images. 
          img1
          img2
          img3
  subfolder2 -> as a submenuitem2
       sub-subfolder1 -> as a title and beneath the images. 
          img1
          img2
          img3
       sub-subfolder2 -> as a title and beneath the images. 
          img1
          img2
          img3
```

I hope there is an other trick around to handle such weird setting ?

Thx again.
