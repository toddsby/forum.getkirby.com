Text: I'm pushing for using Kirby in our next big project, but there's one key thing I know we can do easily in our current CMS, but I'm not sure the best way to go about it in Kirby.

We want to relate content on some pages to content in other sections. For example, we would have an ecommerce "solution" page and we would pull in a logo and blurb from a couple of partners (one section) and a couple of customers (another section) that are related to that ecommerce solution.

I assume we could go the route of having tags or categories, and then pull from the customers and partners sections using a category that matches one from the solution page. But for other things, we may want to be more explicit. Like I may want to pull a blurb from a specific page.

How would I go about doing that? Could I have a field in my text file for the solution page, for example, where I could enter a list of customer page slugs and then content from those would be pulled in? Will that work?

As an aside, something I think wouldn't currently work but would be a great feature for some of our users would be to have the ability to create a field in the control panel that would give a list of things to choose from, and have that list populated by a certain site section. So I could have two fields, one for partner and one for customers, and the Panel user would be able just to pick the items instead of manually entering the name.
