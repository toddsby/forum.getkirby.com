Text: Another way is to link pages by their URI.

So for example in the content file for one page you could link to a different page like this: 

```
Title: Some title
----
Text: Some nice text
----
related: projects/project-1

```

In your template for that page you can get the related page object like this: 

```
<?php $related = $pages->find($page->related()) ?>

<?php if($related): ?>
<h2>Related:</h2>
<a href="<?php echo $related->url() ?>"><?php echo html($related->title()) ?></a>
<?php endif ?>

```

You can extend this by adding a list of related pages: 

```
Title: Some title
----
Text: Some nice text
----
related: projects/project-1, blog/my-article, contact
```

â€¦and in your template:

```
<?php 

// split the string of related uris by comma
$relatedraw = str::split($page->related());
$related    = array();

foreach($relatedraw as $r) {
  // make sure to only add found related pages
  if($rel = $pages->find($r)) $related[] = $rel;
}

?>

<?php if(!empty($related)): ?>
<h2>Related:</h2>

<?php foreach($related as $r): ?>
<a href="<?php echo $r->url() ?>"><?php echo html($r->title()) ?></a>
<?php endforeach ?>

<?php endif ?>

```
