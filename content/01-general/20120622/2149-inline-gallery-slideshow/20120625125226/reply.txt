Text: Thanks for the reply Bastian.
I am sorry but, the code I put here on my last comment was retyped and I didn't pay enough atention to it.

What I actually have is :

$project = $pages->find('projects/'.get('id'));

and it is getting all the info from the page. so this is actually working. its just not getting the images at all.
