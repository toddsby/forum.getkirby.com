Text: So here's what I would like to do.

1. Have users for the control panel with some custom data stored in the user (like a pretty name, brief bio, and image).
2. When the user saves an article, an author field gets filled out with their username.
3. The article page pulls the custom info from the user record based on username and displays it on the page.

So this raises a couple of questions:
1. Is it possible to have a field that automatically saves the author name to the record when someone creates the record from the control panel, or will the user have to fill in a field manually?
2. Is it possible to pull information from the panel user records and display it on the site, or do I need to have a separate authors content section where that data comes from?
