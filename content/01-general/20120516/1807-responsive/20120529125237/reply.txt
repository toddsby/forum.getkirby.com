Text: I have to agree with @joschie that it's better to work with mediaqueries and maybe additional javascript to optimize the same templates for mobile devices. 

If you really need to build a dedicated mobile version, you could change the location of the templates and snippets folders dynamically in your config file: 

```php

c::set('root.templates', c::get('root.site') . '/templates-mobile');
c::set('root.snippets', c::get('root.site') . '/snippets-mobile');

```

If you combine that with the built-in multi-environment config files: <http://getkirby.com/blog/multi-environment-setup> it should be simple to switch those folders according to the subdomain.
