Text: Hi everyone!

I'm just delving into php and am using Zurb's Foundation 4 as the framework for the my site. 

My issue is with the "reveal" modal that appears when one presses "BLOG" on my nav. I have checked that I linked all necessary js and styling files.

It works fine [pre-kirby](http://kvng.co/portfolio/work.html), but not [post-kirby](http://kvng.co/kirby). Something is working, however, as it appends a # to the url (but not on the pre-kirby config).

Could it be an issue with having my site currently in a subfolder of my root? I have followed all the instructions in changing the config.php and .htaccess. 

Thanks in advance!
