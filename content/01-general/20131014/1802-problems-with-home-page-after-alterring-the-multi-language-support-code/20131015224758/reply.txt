Text: THANK YOU! It had nothing to do with the config.php at all. I just renamed the picture that was named "cover". Not finding the header picture somehow caused kirby to not display the whole "home" page.
After I renamed it to cover, all worked perctly fine again.
Thanks for the hint! 
Totally noob question but you guys helped me out anyway. Great comunity f√ºr a great system. Thanks again. Solved.
