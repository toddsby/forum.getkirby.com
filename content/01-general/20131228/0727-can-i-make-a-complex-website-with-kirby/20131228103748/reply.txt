Text: Hi and welcome to the Kirby forum! :)

I don't think this will work very well, as opening and parsing millions of files to search something in the contents will take some time.

But Kirby doesn't *limit* you to use the flat directory structure:
This forum, for example, is built with Kirby but works with some kind of database server in the background (most likely MySQL).
You can do the same thing: Use the Kirby directory structure for your "normal" pages like contact, about etc. and a database for the complex data.

Cheers,
Lukas
