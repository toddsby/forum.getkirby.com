Text: No worries, this very common.

You need to check if the object (an image in this case) *exists* first. Try this:

    <?php if($image = $page->images()->first()): ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>">
    <?php endif ?>

Also, I noticed you have an `excerpt()` function in there, which is strictly used to (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/formatting-text text: trim and remove formatting for text). So, no need for that.

Hope this helps you out!
