Text: Yes, well, of course after writing that post I realized I should just try that url and see what happens.  It loads the default (i.e. default.php) template and seems to automatically pull the home page content. 

So I think my instinct was correct about this functionality needing to be built in. But how to go about it? 

My thinking at first is to do something along the lines of the search plugin. Instantiate a category object for example, within the default template, that retrieves the right content. But it would be nice to rig it up so that the content is loaded up in $page already. That seems to be the more perfect solution. Ideas?

Also, it would be nice if the categories could actually be retrieved using what in Wordpress would be called a pretty permalink, e.g.:

    http://mysite.org/categories/ours

Any input or hints would be much appreciated. Am I thinking in the "Kirby" way?
