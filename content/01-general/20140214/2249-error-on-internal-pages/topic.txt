Text: Hello,

I got the homepage to run in Kirby, but I am getting this error now on the internal pages:

{"status":"error","msg":"The file could not be written"}


I can't seem to find any documentation on it, and I suspect its a permission setting but not sure. Any help would be appreciated!
