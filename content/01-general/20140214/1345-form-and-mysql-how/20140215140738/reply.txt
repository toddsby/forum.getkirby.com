Text: Thanks for the reply. I wasn't sure of the extent of the normal file system, whether a formhandler.php file in the site somewhere would be covered. The way I did it, obviously not.

I have sorted it though – just have the form handling script on the form page and take the Ajax url ref. out. Easy. But if I had wanted to keep the form handler separates I would have just used normal MySQL queries.
