Text: The MAMP tutorial explains how to install a website localy.
You can visit the website by http://localhost:8888/mywebsite.

It doesn't explain how to install it on a remote MAMP, on a host.
There the website is visited by http://mywebsite.com.

The solution is probably somewhere between:
 - using MAMP (pro?) accordingly with the Apache built in OS X Server
 - using correctly the Apache built in OS X Server (better practice I suppose)

To use the Apache built in OS X Server, there are probably parameters to set up or in Kirby, or in Apache, or in both... ?

I asked help directly from Bastian by mail a week ago. He answered very shortly twice without helping strongly on this last question. And after that, no news! :-(

I like Kirby but I am not sure Bastian has time enough to manage all the projects he has and to bring enough support to Kirby users. It seems there is a big difference in the support approach with the Perch team, for instance. It seems it's quite a problem for me and I ask myself if it is a good idea to continue to invest so much time on Kirby... ?
