Text: I create a website with Kirby with an iMac in MAMP.
I use GitHub to sync my dev and prod machines.

For both machines, my setups in config.php are:
URL Setup
c::set('url', false);
Subfolder Setup
c::set('subfolder', false);

On the dev iMac with MAMP, everything is working perfectly.

When I publish my website to my prod host, an OS X Server machine, with exactly the same setups, the links are broken.

For instance, when I click to the blog link, this message appears:
"Not Found
The requested URL /website/blog was not found on this server.
Apache/2.2.24 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.4.17 mod_ssl/2.2.24 OpenSSL/0.9.8y Server at website.com Port 80"

I would appreciate a lot some help to solve this problem! ;-)
