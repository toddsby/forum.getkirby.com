Text: Hi,
I have to update a client-project.
right now you can see a navigation (text) with all customers. When you click on a customer you see a submenu with the projects, eg. website or brochure.

Now I want a "filter" where I can show all projects from "web" and only show the customers name.

I have no idea how to start.

you can check the website I am writing about here:

thx for your help!
