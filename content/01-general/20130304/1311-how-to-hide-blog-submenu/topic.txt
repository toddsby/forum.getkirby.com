Text: Hello.

I'm trying to move my blog (Wordpress) to Kirby. I've exported all articles with Kirby exporter and everything went ok.

Now I have this problem. I've created this phps like documentation shows:
blog.php
blogarticle.php

But I have this problem. I want to hide the list of articles (in the content that exporter gives me, also have a number of folder article). Marked in green in the screenshot.

This is what I have:
http://magarciaguerra.com/blog.gif

If I delete the folder number, blog.php doesn't show any post.

Thanks a lot
Miguel :)
