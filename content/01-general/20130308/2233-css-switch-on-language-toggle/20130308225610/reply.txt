Text: I was able to make this work using:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/<?php echo l::get("language-toggle") ?>" />

While setting 'language-toggle' in the as a language variable:

en.php:
    l::set('language-toggle', 'foundation.css');
ar.php:
    l::set('language-toggle', 'foundationarabic.css');

This seems to be working fine for now. But I do have a feeling that there might be an easier/better way.
