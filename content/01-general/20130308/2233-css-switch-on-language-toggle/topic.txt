Text: I'm trying to switch css files on a language toggle. It doesn't seem to be working. I tried:

    <?php if ($page->content('en')): ?>
        <?php echo css('assets/styles/foundation.css') ?>
    <?php elseif($page->content('ar')): ?>
        <?php echo css('assets/styles/foundationarabic.css') ?>
    <?php endif ?>

Didn't work. I need to switch css files since English is ltr and Arabic is rtl. I hope there's something I can do. This hole project depends on it. I've looked through the forums/docs/tutorials. Didn't find something relevant.

Thanks.
