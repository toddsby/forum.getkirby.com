Text: If there is only one instructor per workshop, same idea with find and maybe a *filterby*? Take your workshop instructor name variable (name and $workshopInstructor) and use it as a variable to filter the results by the Instructor name.

```php
->filterby(name,$workshopInstructor)
```

If there is more than one then I presume it is a comma separated array and then you'd just loop through that finding the detail of each.
