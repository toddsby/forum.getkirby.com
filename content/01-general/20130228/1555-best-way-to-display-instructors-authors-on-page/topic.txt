Text: Hello,

I'm trying to display images of instructors on the details of workshops listed on my home page (and elsewhere). Current structure:

    - content
        - instructors
            - instructorone
                - instructorname.txt
            - instructortwo
        - workshops
            - 01-workshopone
                - workshop.txt
            - 02-workshoptwo

In my workshop.txt, I have "instructors: instructorone, instructortwo". I'd like to be able to pull their images out of the instructors folders correspondingly and display them on the homepage.

What would be the best way to achieve this?

Here's an image mockup of how I want it to look like:
