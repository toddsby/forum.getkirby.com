Text: On my article page (link: http://rhinofeed.net/chrome-extension-chime) I have an issue with Fancybox.

This is what's in my article.txt file. (Wish I didn't have to have that div... but that's another issue)

Noticed when you click on the image, the fancybox works fine - it shows the image in a lightbox. But when you close out of the lightbox, the image disappears completely from the article. Anyone else having this issue?
