Text: Sorry, I see what you mean. 

I guess this maybe a bug unless someone else knows how to do it? 


1. Change the calling [FancyBox JavaScript](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) to specify the link (rather than img element)?
2. You could do it with extended markdown?

You should probably log it as a bug, however I can see why it is done like this as it is difficult to know which element to put the class on.

In the best of both worlds KirbyText should allow for two classes, one for the image and one for the link. It currently only takes the last one you set if I do something like this:

```
( image: img.jpg  class: myImgClass  alt:AltText link: http://me.com  class: myLinkClass )
```

```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myLinkClass" 
title="img"  alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```

When what you would like would be something like:
```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myImgClass" 
title="img" alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```
