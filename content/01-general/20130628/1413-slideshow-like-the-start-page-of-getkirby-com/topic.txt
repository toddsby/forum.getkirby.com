Text: hello, 
i couldn't find the right explanation how to place the slideshow, into the site. 

i had try to follow the others entries but no result. 

since last week i'm new with Kirby and script. i'm just start to learn the script structure and set up my personal website. 

have someone a good link where i can understand how i build the slideshow? at the moment i have the pictures one below the other. 
but i like to have a slideshow instead like the startpage of getkirby. 

thanks, teimaz
