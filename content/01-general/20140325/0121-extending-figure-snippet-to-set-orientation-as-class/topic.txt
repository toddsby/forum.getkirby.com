Text: I've been fooling around in figure.php and kirbytext.php trying to figure this out but I can't..

How could I do something like:

    if($image->height() >= $image->width()) {
      $class = 'vertical';
    } else {
      $class = 'horizontal';
    }

    // start the html output        
    $html  = "<figure class='$class'>";            
    $html .= $this->image($params);
