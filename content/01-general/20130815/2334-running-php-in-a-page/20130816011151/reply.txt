You can absolutely do this in Kirby, although it would need solid templates/plugins.

I'm writing a very similar project at the moment for a teacher, and as part of that have put together a plugin to handle multiple question types and an admin interface, and templates for the question types.

I've actually completed the question and data collection side of it - I'm currently wrapping up the admin interface and some minor design tweaks - and at no point is the teacher required to use any php in their content.
