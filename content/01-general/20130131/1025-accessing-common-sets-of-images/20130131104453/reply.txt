Text: Just use `$pages->find("the-page-you-want")->images()` (didn't test it, but it should work fine).

Maybe add another invisible site where you put your common files in, e.g. "common-files". Then you just use `$pages->find("common-files")->images()` and read them out just as they were on the actual page.
