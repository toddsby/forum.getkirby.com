Text: All right. It was actually @vis7mac who provided the code.

Create an htaccess file in the root of your site with the following code:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /subfolder/$1


**Edit:** Ah, I see you already tried this. For some reason I never got your error using the Panel.
