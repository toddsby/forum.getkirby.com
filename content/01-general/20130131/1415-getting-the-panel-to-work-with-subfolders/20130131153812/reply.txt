Text: Thanks again for the help. I did already try your suggestion, and also several variations on it. No luck.

However, further testing has shown that this doesn't appear to be a .htaccess problem.

If I add the following code to the top of /subfolder/panel/index.php

    echo "Hello"; exit;

... this test works. No redirect problems. Of course this still doesn't make the Panel work but at least I know that the correct .php file is loading.

It seems that the Panel is ignoring my config setting ...

    c::set('subfolder', '/');

I'll keep trying :(
