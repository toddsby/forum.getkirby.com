Text: Ah, okay, now I got you. I guess this occurs because the panel got its own part in the .htaccess:

	# make panel links work
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule ^panel/(.*) panel/index.php [L]

What if you change the last line to `RewriteRule ^panel/(.*) subfolder/panel/index.php [L]` ? (like I said, I'm not an expert, so maybe it's bullshit, but nevertheless, just try it ;)).
