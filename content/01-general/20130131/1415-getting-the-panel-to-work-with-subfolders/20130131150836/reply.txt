If I set the following...

     (c::set('subfolder', 'subfolder');

... then all of my urls throughout the entire site become `/subfolder/about-us` - but they should only be `/about-us` - if that makes sense.

Using only a forward slash was recommended here:

... and it works fine, until I try to install the Panel :(
