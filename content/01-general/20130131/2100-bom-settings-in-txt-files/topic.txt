Text: I have been using Kirby for a wireframe for a client and am really liking it. 

I noticed that the kirby-panel emits BOM markers at the beginning of the txt files and was wondering if there is a way to disable that? (while still keeping the UTF-8 encoding) 

The reason I ask is that some of my editors and git (apparently) treat the BOM marker as a change in the file.
