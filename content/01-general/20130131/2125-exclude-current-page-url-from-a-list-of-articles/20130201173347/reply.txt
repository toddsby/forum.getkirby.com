Text: @fitzage Thanks for that. Works perfectly, so my code now looks like this:

    <h2>You might also be interested in…</h2>
    <ul>
    <?php foreach($pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->limit(5) as $article): ?>
    <?php if ($page != $article) { ?>
    <li><a href="<?= $article->url() ?>"><?= html($article->title()) ?></a></li>
    <?php } ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>

Afraid my PHP prowess does not extend to always showing three articles in the event the current article has to be excluded. Instead, I upped it to `limit(5)`, meaning a minimum of four will be displayed.

This is probably all rudimentary PHP if you know what you’re doing. I’ve yet to figure out the best way to learn more.

Thanks again, @Wordius
