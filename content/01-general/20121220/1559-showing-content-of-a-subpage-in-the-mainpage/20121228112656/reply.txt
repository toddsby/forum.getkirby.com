Text: I guess you would create a template named story.php in the site/templates folder and name your Story txt-file story.txt

In the template you do your usual snippet() stuff and this is how you would include the first subpage of Story:

	<?php

	snippet('header')

	$first_story = $page->children()->visible()->first();

	?>

	<h2><?php echo html($first_story->title()) ?></h2>
	<?php echo kirbytext($first_story->text()) ?>
	
	<?php
	snippet('footer');
	?>

Is this what you were looking for or didn't I understand it correctly?
