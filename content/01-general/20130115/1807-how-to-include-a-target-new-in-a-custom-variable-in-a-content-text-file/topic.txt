Text: Hi,

Well the topic pretty much says it all :-)

In my content.txt I have a variable (replace the square brackets for curved ones):

    link: [link: http://www.website.com text: Name of the website]  

In the template I refer to this variable like this:

    <p class="projecturl"><?php echo kirbytext($page->link())?></p>

The url works, but I want it to open in a new window/tab.
How can I do that. In pure HTML one would add 'target="new"' to the href tag, but I cannot figure out how to that in my situation.
