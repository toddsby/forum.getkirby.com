Text: You could get all the images from each of the subfolders, and then use `Pages::merge()` to combine them. Then you can do whatever you want with ordering those.

`Pages::merge()` takes comma-separated sets of pages. Probably easiest to put them in variables first and then assign the results of the merge to a variable.

```php
<?php
    $mergedpages = Pages::merge($set1, $set2, $set3);
    foreach($mergedpages->shuffle() AS $page) :
```

Blah, blah. You should get the idea.
