I've been stuck at this problem for an hour now, maybe I'm just not seeing it.. Is there a simple way to get all images from multiple subdirectories at once?

So let's say I'm building a photo-blog. On the main page I want a stream of **all** images, sorted by newest first. I also want to be able to filter photos by different categories.

My filestructure is as follows:

(image: http://d.pr/i/dCUM+)

Now, if i simply want to get all images from their subcategories, I would use 2 foreach-loops

    foreach($pages->find('photos')->children()->visible()->shuffle() as $category) {
        ...
        foreach($category->images()) {
            ... echo the image
        }
    }

So far so good. The thing is, the images are now ordered by their category, which is obviously what the first foreach-loop does. 

What I'm looking for is something like: 

    foreach($site->allImages()->flip() as $image) {
        echo $image->url();
    }

more precisely

    foreach($pages->find('photos')->children->images()->flip() as $image) {
        echo $image->url();
    }

Is there a simple way to achieve this?

Thanks in advance!
