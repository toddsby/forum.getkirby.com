Text: I've just uploaded a new version of the search plugin, which has a new "include" option: 

```php
$search  = new search(array(
  'searchfield' => 'search', 
  'include'     => 'visible'
));
$results = $search->results();
```

The include option can be set to "visible", "invisible" or "all", which is the default value. 

By setting it to visible, only visible pages will be include in search results â€“ who would have thought that :)

I hope this helps!
