Text: Hello All,

I'm curious if anyone has experimented with, or been successful in, customizing page content and template file naming conventions. 

Default Behavior in Kirby
Content file page123.txt uses template page123.php if it exists. Otherwise, page123.txt would use default.php.

Desired Modification
Content file page123.page.txt would use page.php template if exists. Otherwise, page123.page.txt would use default.php.

There are a few reasons this would be helpful, namely each content file would be named logically after the page. For example: contact.page.txt, about-us.page.txt, and mission.page.txt. By just looking at the file names it's clear which page each of these three files is connected to. 

It's true that the Kirby default would point the above files to the default.php template, however, as a site grows and many different templates start to become needed the filenames start to look the same. For instance, if you have a template for blogs, regular pages, individual contacts, and shop items you're going to have A LOT of files named the same; blog.txt, page.txt, contact.txt, and shop.txt. The only way you could tell the difference between each of these files is by physically looking through the directory structure. However, if a blog post content file was named visiting-nyc.blog.txt you could easily do a file name search for "nyc" or "blog" and see all files with easy to understand file names.

I did search the forum first before posting this and I didn't turn up anything. I'm sorry if I missed something that's already out there!

Thanks,
