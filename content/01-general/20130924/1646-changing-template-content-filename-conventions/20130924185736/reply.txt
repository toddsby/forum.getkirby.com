Text: The custom post types article mentioned above should help as long as you use snippets to minimize duplicate code. It doesn't fully solve your problem, but it's a similar idea. You'd end up with more templates required than with your idea, though.

You could also just invest in a good text editor like Sublime Text 2 that has good fuzzy searching of folders within a project. Makes life easier.
