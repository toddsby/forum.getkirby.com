Text: This is a follow-up question, which is already in (link: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:1042 text: this) thread, but I thought it worth creating a new, more specific topic for anyone who may be asking in the future.

I'm running a script that receives data from an XML feed (webhook), and when it runs it finds a specific "product.txt" file and reduces the product's inventory by the number sold.

I can get this to work if I place the script in templates/inventory.php and create a new .txt file as /content/admin/inventory/inventory.txt

Ideally, though, I would like to keep the content folder completely clear for my client, as well as keeping the admin scripts out of bounds.


For what it's worth, here is my test inventory.php template:

	<h1>Inventory Control</h1>

	<?php

	$artist = 'forkin-tom';
	$product = 'iphonedock';
	$projecttxt = $pages->find('artists')->children()->find("$artist")->children()->find("$product")->files()->find('project.txt')->root();

	echo $projecttxt."<br>";
	echo $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'assets/test/project.txt';

	$sold =             1;

	$path_to_file =     $projecttxt;
	$file_contents =    file_get_contents($path_to_file);
	$invpos =           (strpos($file_contents, "Inventory: "))+11;
	$inventory =        substr($file_contents, $invpos, 3);
	$invlen = 			preg_match_all( "/[0-9]/", $inventory );
	$newinv =           $inventory-$sold;
	$file_contents = 	substr_replace($file_contents, $newinv, $invpos, $invlen);

	file_put_contents($path_to_file, $file_contents);

	?>
