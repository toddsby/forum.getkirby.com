Text: Hello, this is a newbie question.
Tried to find a working solution in this forum, but to no effect ;-((

Problem is:
I would like to set a link to an expression like this.
<starting>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832)</starting> (including the biographical data in parentheses) should be within the link which is not as simple as one should think. Or at least, as I thought ...

I tried (, I tried &#40;, I tried ''', I tried ```

The results were interesting but not really what I had in mind.

Maybe I'm blinded with parentheses now. Anyone can help?
