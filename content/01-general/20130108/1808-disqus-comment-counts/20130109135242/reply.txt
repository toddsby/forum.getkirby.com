Text: The only difference between these two snippets is the file loaded from the Disqus server.

The second one (counts.js) only contains count information, the first (embed.js) only the comment form itself.

You can also get the comment count using this snippet (save it as count.php in `site/snippets/`):

```php
<?php
$shortname = "YOUR_DISQUS_SHORTNAME";
$url = 'http://' . $shortname . '.disqus.com/count.js?q=1&0=1,' . str_replace("/blog/", "", $identifier);
$countJs = @file_get_contents($url);

str_replace(' ', '', $countJs);

if(preg_match('/DISQUSWIDGETS.displayCount((.*))/si', $countJs, $matches)) {
	$count_json = @json_decode($matches[1], true);
	$count = $count_json['counts'][0]['comments'];
	echo $count; // echo the comment count
} else {
	echo "-"; // No comments or could not get data
}
```

In your template, you can use it like so:

```php
<?php snippet("disquscount", array("identifier" => $article->uri())); ?>
```

It will then echo the count at the position where you call it.

Please note that it is not quite fast because of the slow Disqus API.
