Text: I created a new template "preview.php" and with it I am loading the first image in the "content/preview/blah" folder. I am not using a *.txt file but if I don't include one then the default.php template file is used rather than the custom one I set up.

How do I set this up so that my "preview.php" template is used without including a ".txt" file in the "content/preview/blah" folder?

Thanks!
