Text: Hi there,

does anyone know if / how I can exclude a folder from rendering in the /content folders?

Example:

 > content/01-project-a
 > content/01-project-b
 > content/01-project-c
 > content/test
 > content/test/test.html

while I'd like all project folders to be rendered I'd like the test folder and it's contents (.html, .css and .js files) to be rendered the usual way. 

What ways are there to do this? 
Cheers, Markus
