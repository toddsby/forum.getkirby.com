Text: Hi Russ,

as far as I see it right TCP searches for all tags of the whole site, while I just need the one for the currently viewed article. TCP also gives back the tags themselves, while I would need the articles with this tag to display something like

> Further posts in the category:
> link to article 1
> link to article 2
> etc.

Can I somehow achieve this with the TCP, or are we talking about different things here?

Thanks,
Adam
