Text: You will need more in your .htaccess to make nice URL's work.
You can download the default [Kirby file from GitHub.](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms)

You may well have to add your line to the top of this file:
`AddType application/x-httpd-php5 .html .htm`

Although I'm not sure why you'd want to process html/htm as PHP? Maybe it is for setting PHP5?
