Text: This may be a dumb question: 
I've uploaded a site via FTP. Everything looked fine on localhost, but on the live site, some - but not all - of the kirbytext fields aren't being recognized. (ie instead of the title saying "Contact Us", it says "Title: Contact Us ---- Text: To contact us...")
I tried it on my own hosting, and it worked fine. Any thoughts?
