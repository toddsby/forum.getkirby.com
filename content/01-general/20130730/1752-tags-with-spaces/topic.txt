Text: I'm using the tagcloud with success to sort a portfolio. Now, I have a "tag" that is 2 words "annual reports". The space breaks the isotope.js sort.

Is there a way to turn the space into a dash or just remove it? I could put the dash in the tag, but this carries over to the display of the tag on the page. There has to be a way to strip the space, right?

Thanks for your time.
