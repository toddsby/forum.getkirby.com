Text: Hey, @craig_lock. I encountered the same issue and used your simple solution to fix it, however, I have one more issue. On the front end, my "Mood+Board" tag displays fine, as "Mood Board" in the list of tags featured in my sidebar. I also list the tags under each blog post, on both the blog page and the pages for each blog post. My tag displays as "Mood+Board" there because it is being called differently. How can I make it display without the + there?

Visit my website here to see what I mean. http://jenniferhail.com/blog/sister's-graduation-mood-board-01

I am using the following code...

<pre><code>< ?php foreach(str::split($article->tags()) as $tag): ? >
< a href="< ?php echo url('blog/tag:' . urlencode($tag)) ? >" >
< ?php echo html($tag) ? ></a>
< ?php endforeach ? >
</code></pre>

One more question. Does anyone know how to list multiple tags with a comma separator, using the code above?
