Text: Well, without editing the tagcloud plugin, the spot in your code that you need to adjust would be:

    ->filterBy('tags', param('tag'), ',');

to

    ->filterBy('tags', urldecode(param('tag')), ',');


That may not be the only place, but that's the general idea. Everywhere you use param('tag') you need to urldecode it. You could create a variable at the top of the page to hold it and then use that throughout the page.
