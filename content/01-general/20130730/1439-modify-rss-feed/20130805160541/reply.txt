Text: Yes, that's the one I'm talking about, and it links to the actual article. Yet it isn't just limited to the first article/all quote-posts, it also happened when using other fields, for example `$item->links()`. I'm unable to find the exact problem though, since it doesn't happen with every field...it's just strange.
