Text: @russbaldwin Thanks for the answer. I've tried fiddling around with this, and everything kinda works now on my local setup. I say "kinda", because there is still one problem left. For example, this code:

	<description>
		<?php if($item->quote() !=''): ?>
		  <?php foreach($item->quote() as $quote): ?>
		    <![CDATA[<div><blockquote><?php echo $quote ?></blockquote></div>]]>
		  <?php endforeach ?>
		<?php endif ?>
		<![CDATA[<?php echo kirbytext($item->{$descriptionField}) ?>]]>
	</description>

displays the quote from the article, but strangely adds a link to the main article at the end. See the picture:

Same thing happens when using any another field besides images. Is there any way I can fix this?
