Text: Hello,

I've just uploaded kirbycms w/panel to my Live test folder and something weird's going on.

The homepage has loaded without any assets - "view source" shows that the URLs have been constructed with https instead of just http.

Clicking on any menu items yield an: Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): The connection was reset.

No ssl is required on my web host. ssl is set to 'false' in config.php and everything works fine on my localhost windows machine.

Little help here please?

Thanks,
