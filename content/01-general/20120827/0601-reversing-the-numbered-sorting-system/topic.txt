Text: Hi all!

I was wondering if it would be possible to reverse the order in which Kirby reads content, i.e.:

`01-article`: last
`02-article`: second
`03-article`: first

instead of 

`01-article`: first
`02-article`: second
`03-article`: last

For example, if I wanted to add images to a portfolio folder (in 01-02-03-04 order, the largest number == the most recent), using a `foreach` dependent gallery would display the images in order from least to most recent. I'd like to have the images automatically display in order from most recent to least recent.

Is there some code I can edit (`sort`/`rsort`?) to change the way Kirby reads numbers? Or should I create a new field stating my preferred order in the text file metadata for each object?

I'd love to hear about workarounds or solutions that I might be missingâ€” how do you efficiently add new content (e.g., blog posts, projects)?

Thanks for your help!

Best,
Gabrielle
