Text: I just conquered this issue yesterday. The key is to use ACL for permissions, instead of trying to switch users or groups.

Here's the important steps for setting up Dropbox: https://gist.github.com/facelordgists/8345435

Here's the part that pertains to you:

### Give www-data user read and write access to Dropbox files

Install Access Control List

    sudo apt-get install acl

Give www-data user read, write & execute access to dropbox files

    setfacl -Rm u:www-data:rwx /root/Dropbox

Set as default, recursively to inherit these settings on newly created files

    setfacl -dRm u:www-data:rwx /root/Dropbox
