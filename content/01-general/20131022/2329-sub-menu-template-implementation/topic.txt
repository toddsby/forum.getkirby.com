Text: I want to add a side menu to my **event.php** template with links to each year page visible under **event-one**.
Don't know if this can be acomplished by modifing the submenu snippet a little bit.
My knowledge of PHP is limited.

I would like to use the same **event.php** template for **event-two** and **three** pages 
which consist of the same, by year, page structure as the **event-one** if possible.

My **content** folder look like this.



    W:\content
    ··· 01-about-us
    ··· 02-events
        ··· 01-event-one
            ··· 01-2011
                ... event.txt
            ··· 02-2012
                ... event.txt
            ··· 03-2013
                ... event.txt
        ··· 02-event-two
        ··· 03-event-three
        ... events-home.txt
    ··· error
    ··· home




Any help would be really apreciated.
