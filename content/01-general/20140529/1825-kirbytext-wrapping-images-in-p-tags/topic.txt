Text: Whenever I use the echo kirbytext php tags kirbytext will wrap   
my images in paragraph tags. I'd love to know how to counteract 
this, kind of screws with the css a lot. Thanks!

So essentially this snippet from a markdown text file:
     
     Poke around and take a look at our new work. Thanks for checking 
     out our new site. 

     (image:blog_post_1_image.jpg title:Big things have small 
     beginnings alt:Big things have small beginnings)
     (image:blog_post_1_image2.jpg title:Eggshell with Romalian type 
     alt:Eggshell with Romalian type)
     (image:blog_post_1_image3.jpg title:Put a lightning bolt on it 
     alt:Put a lightning bolt on it)
     (image:blog_post_1_image4.jpg title:You can ignore us on any 
     size now alt:You can ignore us on any size now)

Will output this:

     <p>Poke around and take a look at our new work. Thanks for
