Text: Hi!
In `/products/my-product/my-product.txt` I tried to link to a file in another folder with the file having spaces in the name, but that redirects me to the homepage! Any idea why? 

Here's what I tried:

`- (file: service/the-manuals/My manual.pdf text: Manual`

I also tried this without luck:

`- (file: service/the-manuals/My%20manual.pdf text: Manual`

and:

`- (file: 04-service/the-manuals/My%20manual.pdf text: Manual`

PS: Adding the closing paranthesis renders the code instead of showing it. Maybe a bug with this forum?
