Text: I've configured the rewrite rule in config.php to true. 

c::set('rewrite', true);

It doesn't work, meaning I get 404 when I try to navigate between pages. The site works fine (albeit with /index.php/ in URLs, obviously) when rewrite is set to false.

I'm running my site locally using MAMP. I've also uploaded it to my webserver (Dreamhost) and the problem persists. 

What am I doing wrong? I've done some Googling and I'm not sure what Kirby tries to set vs what I need to set on my end re: .htaccess.
