Text: Brief disclaimer - my laptop's screen has died, so I am on my netbook and am unable to test any code out.

However, what I would test if I could is the following:

    <?php echo 'Project number ' . $pages->indexOf($page) . ' of ' . $pages->count(); ?>

Note that `$pages` in this context could be a pages object you've built yourself using `$page->children()->visible()` or whatever.
