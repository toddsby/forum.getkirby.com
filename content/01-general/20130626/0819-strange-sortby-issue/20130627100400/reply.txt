Text: Hi Russ, thanks for your answer. 

Yes, I also thought that sorting will work anyway, but if I put the date in the blogarticle.txt in dd/mm/yyyy format, eg.

> Date: 26/02/2013

the sorting is messed up. As I modified the date format in every txt to mm/dd/yyyy, like

> Date: 02/26/2013

sorting was all good. Strange, but if this is what it takes, I'll do it this way. :)

Anyway, thanks!
