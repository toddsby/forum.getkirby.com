Text: Hi,

I've came across a strange ordering issue on my blog and I thought someone might help me out.

There are four posts on my site (01-04, where 01 is the oldest one and 04 is the newest). On my homepage I display the latest post with the code

    $articles = $page->children()->visible()->flip()->paginate(1)

That works just fine, displaying the latest article.

However, when I try to create an archive page (displaying all the articles) there's an ordering issue. Instead of displaying posts in the order of 04-03- 02-01, what I got is 03-02-01-04.

The code I use is

    $blog = $pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->sortBy($sort='date', $dir='asc')->flip()->paginate(3)

If I switch to "asc" ordering, the issue still remains and the order will be 04-01-02-03. Always the latest article is the problem. 

All dates are set to "dd/mm/yyyy" in the blogarticle.txt, so different formats cannot be the problem.

Any ideas? Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Adam
