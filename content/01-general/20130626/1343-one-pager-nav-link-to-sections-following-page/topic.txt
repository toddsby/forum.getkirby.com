Text: Hi,

my site is a one-pager and it has a following page. IÂ´m using Bastians one-pager navigation.

(BTW: How can I show some flawless php code here? Its my first forum entry!)

The navigation has four items: featured, about, contact and portfolio. 
Structure: content:
- 01-featured
- 02-about
- 03-contact
- 04-portfolio

Item featured, about, contact are sections rendered by section snippets on the homepage.
Item portfolio is a following page! 

So it is **not possible to reach the portfolio page with this navigation.** And: When I`m on the portfolio page it is not possible (but it should be) to go/click back to the homepage-sections!

I have no idea how to change Bastians navigation. Has anybody any suggestions?

Thanks, 
Dan
