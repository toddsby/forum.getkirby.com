Text: Hi, I dont seem to get it to work... it just gets rendered as text.
Did i do something wrong or is there a typo?


here is my php file:
<a title="kirbytext.extended.php" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pdz4hqtbd4qogcv/kirbytext.extended.php">kirbytext.extended.php</a>

And here is how i try to embed it within my project.txt file:

soundcloud:https://soundcloud.com/rap-up-music/sets/little-mix-salute-album


are there any php experts that can spot the error?
I am no coder myself...

thanks a lot!
K.
