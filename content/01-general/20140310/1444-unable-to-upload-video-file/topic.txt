Text: When I try to upload a small (2.4M) video file in the .mp4 format, I get the following error in the upload file popup:

> "The File has not been found"

But the file is most definitely on the drive and is not corrupted. I am able to open it with my video playback software and it runs just fine. 

Does anyone know what's going on here?

**UPDATE** 

I'm getting a series of errors in my php error log that seem relevant: 

> [Mon Mar 10 14:50:08.107147 2014] [:error] [pid 7032] [client 127.0.0.1:37979] PHP Strict Standards:  Non-static method upload::file() should not be called statically in /home/****/Sites/lanningsmith/panel/lib/data.php on line 498, referer: http://lanningsmith.sunny.net/panel/splash/show:files/do:upload-file

**UPDATE 2**

1 - I do not think the above errors are part of the problem as they also appear in the error log when I successfully upload an image. 

2 - I have also now added the mime type 'video/mp4' to the panel config file `/<root>/site/panel/config/config.php`, like so:

     // allowed mime types for file uploads
    c::set('upload.allowed', array(
      'image/jpeg', 
      'image/pjpeg',
      'image/png',
      'image/x-png', 
      'image/gif',
      'video/mp4',
      'video/mpeg',
      'application/pdf',
      'application/gzip',
      'application/zip',
   ));

But this has changed nothing.
