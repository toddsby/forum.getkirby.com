Text: Hey,

I have followed the blog/RSS guides and it all works except one thing I've noticed. In my RSS feed the pubDate is displayed like so:

Tue, 02 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0100

Note that there is no time assigned. In the text files I create the date like so: 

Date: 10/02/2012

I don't really want to add a timestamp to each post too. Is there anyway around this?

Cheers

Marc
