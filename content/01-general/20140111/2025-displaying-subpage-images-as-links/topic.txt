Text: Hi,

I run a small theatre companies website, just starting to port it to Kirby. Figured most of it out myself, but I am stuck on one issue. I have a 'Productions' page and under that a sub-page for each production. What I want to do is have a list of the sub pages on the 'Productions' page, and use the productions poster image as the link. The poster is stored in each production folder.

I've added a

    poster: poster.jpg

section to each productions text file, but I don't know how to output it on the parent page.

Thanks,
