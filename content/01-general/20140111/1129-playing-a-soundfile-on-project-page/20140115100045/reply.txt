Text: there are two steps for solving your problems:

first of all you should look at the cheatsheet to implement the sound file:

    http://getkirby.com/content/02-docs/kirby-cheatsheet.pdf

you have 2 ways to handle the sound file:
1. you set the sound file as a variable in the project.txt:
    ----
    Soundfile: sound.mp3
    ----
2. you use the template file:
   <?php $page->sounds()->url(); ?>

(the codes abouve are just examples).

the second part is to render the template and to play the sound file again.
you can use the html5 tag "audio". for me, normally write a function to play/stop a sound/video file. on buttons click -> play again, on inivtialload -> play again.

so far... let me know (twitter me!) if you need more help.
