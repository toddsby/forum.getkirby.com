Text: After some thinking I don't think it has something to do with htaccess. Sure I can make redirects from one URL to another but the main problem is...

As far as I can see they are not stripped out in the htaccess file. Then they are stripped in the PHP.

The answer to this question is probably to hack the core. Correct me if I'm wrong here.
