Text: I don't think `filterBy('meta_robots_noindex','on')` actually works. The filterBy is limited, and I don't think that's one of the things it does.

Instead, just do a simple conditional like this:

    <?php foreach($pages as $p): ?>
    <?php if($p->meta_robots_noindex() == 'on'): ?>
        Anything with the box checked would be included here, so you would just leave this empty because you don't want them to be displayed.
    <?php else: ?>
        Your code for displaying the pages goes here, and the only ones left are the ones that don't have the box checked.
    <?php endforeach ?>
