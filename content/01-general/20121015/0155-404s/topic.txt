Text: Hello,

I've been trying out Kirby - its great! But...

Weirdly, i've been generating 404 pages (without nice kirby templates) just by adding pages in what seems to be the normal way. Even pages 'left over' from the default theme no longer work. It seems strange, because my php can read the name of a page with $page->title(); etc - but if i link to the page, the URL is correct but the server springs a 404.

I'm running the site with MAMP on my mac, i've tried shutting down the server and restarting it...

Any ideas?

Cheers!
