This is what i did:

step 1: Download Kirby, show invisible files, setup with MAMP
step 2: Get excited, decide to use Kirby as my CMS, get bored with invisible files - turn them off.
step 3: Duplicate Kirby directory, start integrating static html design
step 4: **FAIL!**

During step 3 i duplicated everything **apart** from the .htaccess file! This breaks Kirby, as documented in the MAMP tutorial - you get plain 404 pages... phew!

apologies for a semi-redundant forum post :-)
