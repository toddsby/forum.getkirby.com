I sent an email to Bastian but then I thought it would be less disturbing if i posted the question here.

i'm quite new to Kirby and coding in general.
i've done a few sketches with processing, but i can't seem to embed them in my webpage.
My problem is that processing does not export just a .js file. It s a .pde and a .js file.

I have tried with the tuto css/javascript found here but it isn't work. 

Do anybody have an idea about how i could embed a sketch  ? (made with a .js export) 
thanks !
