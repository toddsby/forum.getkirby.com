Text: Hey guys,

A little confused about something.
I have a list of music files that i have created on my homepage using the following code.

     <?php $projects = $pages->find('audio')->children()->visible()->sortBy('date') ?>
     <?php foreach($projects as $project): ?>
     <li class="item two-thirds column">
     <a href="<?php echo $project->url() ?>"><?php echo $project->title() ?></a>
     </li>
     <?php endforeach ?>

Using the above code I'm able to generate a list of visible sub-pages from the "audio" page in the panel.

It shows each page as a list item and if i add

     <?php echo $project->sounds() ?>

I can then get a pre-made link to the audio file. 

If i wanted to change this so i can get just the path to the file how could i go about this? I tried

     <?php echo $project->sounds()->path() ?> 

with no success.

If any one can throw some light on this it would go a long way to helping me out.

Cheers
