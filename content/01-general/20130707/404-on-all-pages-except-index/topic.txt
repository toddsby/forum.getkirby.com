Text: Hello everyone,

Any help here would be appreciated, I'm getting really confused trying to solve this issue.

Until this point I'd been developing my site locally using Kirby and MAMP. Today I tried to move upload the files to my server via ftp. I did so by copying all of the contents of my local directory into the appropriate directory on the remote server.

The home page works fine, but navigating to any of the subpages results in a 404 error. Googling and digging through the forum has led me to believe that this could be a problem with URL Rewriting and configuration of my VirtualHost file, but I don't know if that's even the answer or how to find/alter those things.

Does anyone know what might be going on here?  I have no idea what to do next. Any and all help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian
