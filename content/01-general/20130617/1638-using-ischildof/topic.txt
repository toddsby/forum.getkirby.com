Text: Hi,

Hope you are well.

I have an category "Work" located at website.com/work/ and want to display something only on children pages of this category.

I guess that best way will be to check if child is really a child of that category using "isChildOf".

So logically I am doing it as:

`<?php if($page->isChildOf('work')): ?>
ba dum tss
<?php endif ?>`

but, (there's always butts) nothing is happening.

P.S. I tried to check for right parent name with "<?php echo $page->parent(); ?>" which is displaying full URL to the parent. Is that right?
