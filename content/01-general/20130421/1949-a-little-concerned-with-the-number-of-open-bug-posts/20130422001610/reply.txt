Text: I use Kirby for a recent site for a client and I'm very pleased with it. For what I used I didn't run into any bugs and it has been a joy to work with.

- I don't use the panel at present
- The only plugin I used is search
- I do know php

The site is at globalstrategies.org

Cheers, Richard
