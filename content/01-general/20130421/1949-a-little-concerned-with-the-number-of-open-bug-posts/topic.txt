Text: Hey guys,

Am really liking Kirby in my tests so far, but as a paid option for a client I do have a little concern with the number of open bug threads there are. Keep in mind that I'm viewing this from using Kirby as a potential business solution, so reliability is very important for obvious reasons.

Wrong to be concerned?

Cheers,
Dave
