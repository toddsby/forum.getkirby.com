Text: I've had a moment of mad genius, but the syntax is so confusing I need help to realise my dream. Here's the current Kirby rewrite rule:

```# make site links work
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]```

Which is clearly very nice, and got me thinking... I don't need to be specific about the /gallery/ folder, I can simply rewrite any `?p=x` statements no matter what page they're on. So I tried this:

```# make site links work
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/([A-Za-z0-9-]+)?$ index.php?p=$1 [L]```

Which is clearly crazy-go-nuts, but thought it might spark something for someone here to help.

Please?
