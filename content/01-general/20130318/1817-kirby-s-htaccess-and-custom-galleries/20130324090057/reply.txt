I presume you have good reason for not using any of the myriad Javascript photo display stuff?

I'm not sure what is wrong with the URL but currently I don't think Kirby does routing, I think it will in the next version, but Bastian would be better able to adivse on that. 

Sadly I am not and .htaccess master but I think you need the routing side as well to do this? 

Sorry I cannot be more help, recovering from a nasty bout of flu and still a bit fuzzy headed.

p.s. I think `<section>` needs a heading directly after it for the HTML5 outline to be OK. Also some of this stuff could be in CSS?
