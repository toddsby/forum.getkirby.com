Text: I'm building an "offline" page for my site that will be displayed when I'm doing lots of behind the scenes work.

The problem I'm having is that I'm using a custom template for this page. In my header snippet, I have some php that checks different variables to determine the status of the site. Long story short, when it decides the site is offline, I want it to load the specific template instead of the one Kirby would usually use.

##For example:
I have a blog post that uses blog.php template.
The blog.php template, like all other parts of my site, invoke the header snippet, where the above logic is performed.

If the php code decides the site is offline, I'd like to force Kirby to use offline.php template for the blog post, despite the existence of blog.php template.

Is this possible? I'd prefer to keep this magic centralized to Kirby itself. Worst case, I can always do it at the server level with NGINX.
