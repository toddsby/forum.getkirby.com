Text: That is returning an empty array. (You can also use `<?php a::show($variable) ?>` to show stuff. Not sure why.

I'm assuming you've checked the spacing of the blueprint file and it is OK, actually it probably wouldn't work in the Panel if not. 
```html
published:
  label: Visibility
  type: radio
  options:
    published: Published
    draft: Draft
  default: published
```
I presume also you change the values for the radio button and have them change in your txt file (from Panel)?

Another approach is to maybe try using just a checkbox for Published? It is either published or not. 

However I think it is the array being empty which is the problem, is it case sensitive?? Maybe try:
```php 
$privatePage = 
$pages->visible()->filterBy('published', 'Published');```

or 

```php 
$privatePage = 
$pages->visible()->filterBy('draft', 'Draft');```
