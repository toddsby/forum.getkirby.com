Text: @russbaldwin, @eytanbiala: i think you missed the $key: using the work by eytanbiala, the $key is "**published**". However he also used the word **published** as a ***value*** for the radio's option. To avoid confusion, maybe use "**status**" as the key, so (i've added everything in the blueprint to make sure :D):

	<?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>
	
	# default blueprint
	
	title: Page
	pages: true
	files: true
	fields:
	  title: 
	    label: Title
	    type:  text
	  text: 
	    label: Text
	    type:  textarea
	    size:  large
	  status: 
	    label: Status
	    type: radio
	    options:
		    published: Published
		    draft: Draft
	  	default: draft

then:

	$draftPages = $pages->filterBy('status', 'draft');
	$publishedPages = $pages->filterBy('status', 'published');

This should work and display all posts with draft chosen on radio button. Note that i used the lowercase for $value, not the "***display value***" which is capitalized.
