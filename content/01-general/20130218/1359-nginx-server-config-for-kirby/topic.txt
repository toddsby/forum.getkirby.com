Text: There seems to be no sample configuration for Nginx + Kirby on the forum. So, just in case anyone else needs it: set 

	c::set('rewrite', true);

in your Kirby config. Then, below is the example of nginx server .conf file (adjust paths as you need):

	## config for Kirby CMS
	server {
	    server_name test.dev;
	    listen  80;
	    root /Test;
	    access_log off;
	    index index.php index.html index.htm;

		location ~ .php {
		    fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;
		    fastcgi_index index.php;
		    include fastcgi_params;
		    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_script_name;
		}
		
		location / {
		    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
		}

	}
