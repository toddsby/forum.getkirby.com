Text: Since Kirby v2 (together with the new Toolkit, App framework and Panel) is not released yet, there's no link to the reference platform.
But you can take a look at it [over here](http://reference.new.getkirby.com).
This platform is basically a GUI to the inline documentation you can find right in the code of all v2 stuff.

Remember that this is beta stuff and should not be used in production yet - it might still change. ;)
