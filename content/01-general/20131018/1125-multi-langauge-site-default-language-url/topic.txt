Text: Hi, I'm building a prototype of a multi-language site with Kirby and I would really like the default language to not show in the URL.

So:

example.com/en/page

becomes

example.com/page

and the other languages remain:

example.com/fr/page
example.com/dr/page
etc

I've tried rewrite rules but I get stuck in a redirect loop as I think Kirby is redirecting to the default language again!

Bastian, ideally I would have this as an option in the config file, something like:

`c::set('lang.default.hidden', true);`

Any thoughts?

Thanks!
