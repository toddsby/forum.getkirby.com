Text: Hi everyone!

I'm wanting to add a Youtube video into my page, however I want it at a specific location amongst my images. Also I'd love to add a caption to it.

I would like it on this page, http://jakestollery.com/works/merge
just below the 'E' image (the one with all the hands). Is there a way to specify where you'd like a Youtube video to show, in relation to the order and amongst the images?

Thanks kindly and apologies for being a bother :)
