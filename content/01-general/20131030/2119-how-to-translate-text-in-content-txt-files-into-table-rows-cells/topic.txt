Text: Sorry if this question is not very specific, but I'm looking for some advice on the best way to do something. 

I am working on a redesign for an artist and I was hoping to style the CV section as a table, organized by year. I imagine organizing everything by year: Solo exhibitions, Group exhibitions, Publications, Reviews, etc. I was thinking I could create a .txt file for each year which would have sections for each of the above categories. E.g. 2013.txt:

    Solo-exhibitions:

    <i>Exhibition Title 1</i>, Venue, Australia

    <i>Exhibition Title 2</i>, Venue, Bristol, United Kingdom

    Group-exhibitions: 
    
    <i>Exhibition Title 3</i>, Venue, Aspen, Colorado

    <i>Exhibition Title 4</i>, Venue, San Francisco, California

I guess my question is: if I were to go about it this way, how would I code it so that **each line would go in its own table row and cell?** E.g. 

    <table>  
        <tbody>  
          <tr>  
            <td><i>Exhibition Title 1</i>, Venue, Australia</td> 
            <td><i>Exhibition Title 2</i>, Venue, Bristol, United Kingdom</td>
            <td>. . .</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

Is this possible? Practical? The CV is very, very long, so I'd like to create a system that's pretty simple and can be easily updated by the clientâ€¦

Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
