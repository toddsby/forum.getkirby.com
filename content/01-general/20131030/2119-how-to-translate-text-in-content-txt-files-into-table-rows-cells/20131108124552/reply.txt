Text: @unexpectedsport Even if you decide not to use tables in the end but a more responsive table-like layout, the yaml-solution is still probably the best option for the structured content of a CV, I guess. It allows you to address all fields separately and you could also put all content into just one file if you like. Like so:

    CVItems:
    
        Exhibition1
            Date: 2011
            Type: Solo Exhibition
            Title: Exhibition Title
            City: Toronto
            ....

Or whatever is the best structure
