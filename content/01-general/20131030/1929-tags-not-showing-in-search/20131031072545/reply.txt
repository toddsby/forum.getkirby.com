Text: Hi,
I'm also new to Kirby and my answer might be totally wrong if so please ignore.

But what I do and for me it works without any issues (at least on a Windows localserver :) is simple this:

From my search page:

      <?php

      $blog = $pages->find('blog');
      $tags = tagcloud($blog);

      ?>

      <?php foreach($tags as $tag): ?>
      <li <?php if($tag->isActive()) echo ' class="active"' ?>><a href="<?php echo $tag->url() ?>"><?php echo umlautepas(str_replace('-',' ', $tag->name)) ?></a></li>
       <?php endforeach ?>

Uhm ignore umlautepas is a function I've created to replace e.g. "Ãœ" with "ue" and vice versa...

regards
