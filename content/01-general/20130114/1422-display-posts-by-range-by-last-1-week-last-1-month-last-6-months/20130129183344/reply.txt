Text: Currently, you'll have to build it all out yourself with a crapload of PHP conditionals. I imagine if you know what you're doing you could build a plugin.

You'll have to manually compare the current date to the date of the posts, probably after converting both to a format that's easily compared mathematically.

I'm not sure how you would go about doing the links exactly. It might be easiest to pass the desired option in a URL parameter. Like /archive/time:month and then if that URL parameter exists, kick in the correct conditional on the archive template, and if that parameter doesn't exist, just show the entire archive.

I'd give you some sample code, but that's a crapload of code and I haven't tested any of it, so you're on your own. :-)
