Text: Ok, not sure why I didn't think of this before, but I just tried this: 

	<?php $featured = $pages->find('projects')->children()->filterBy('status', ''); ?>

I basically left the 'status' value blank in quotes. It seems to be working fineâ€¦ Is there any problem with or downside in doing it this way?

Thanks!
