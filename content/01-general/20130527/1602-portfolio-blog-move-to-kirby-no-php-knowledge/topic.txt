Text: I have my website already up and running. There is no custom PHP in my templates (though it is possible in cms), only proprietary tags.
But I hate SQL databases - the way you move from one server to another.
So can I try to use Kirby without PHP knowledge? HTML and CSS skills are good, of course. I'm ready to learn some PHP tricks but not really interested in mastering it.

Also should I buy license for building my own site, or only for clients sites?
