Text: I can see there's a depth feature which the Tutorial used to output a class from the current page - but am not sure how to use it.

Looking at the syntax here: http://reference.new.getkirby.com/cms/classes/site/methods/depth

It should be something like:

    $crumbs = $site::depth(1)->breadcrumb();

But this results in 'Call to undefined method site::depth()'

Have also tried:

    $crumbs = $site->breadcrumb()->depth(1);

Which results in a non-object error for count() when checking if there are menu items to output:

    if($crumbs->count() > 0):
