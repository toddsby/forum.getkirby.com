Text: Hi,
Does someone has implemented a search query result as XML or Json yet? Would be nice to stay on the search page while posting an Ajax request instead of reloading the whole page?

In the moment I'm trying to implement Ajax with Kirby for the search plugin and contact form as well. I wonder maybe its already done so it would save me some work not reenventing the wheel.

regards
