Text: Hi there,

I'm trying to output an image file with no luck; 01.jpg is in my folder and the code in image.php is:

    <?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg') ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="someTitle" />

This is the error: 
Fatal error:  Call to a member function url() on a non-object
