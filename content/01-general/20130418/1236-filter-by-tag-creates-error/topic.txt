Text: Hi, 
I have searched the forum but can´t find a solution for my problem.

I´m triying an easy tag filtering for a blog using this:


	<?php if(param('topic')) {

	$notes = $pages->find('notes')
	                    ->children()
	                    ->visible()
	                    ->filterBy('topics', param('topic'), ',')
	                    ->flip()
	                    ->paginate(12);

	} else {

	$notes = $pages->find('notes')
	                    ->children()
	                    ->visible()
	                    ->flip()
	                    ->paginate(12);

	}
	?>



In each post I created the "topics:" field.

The URL is correct: http:.../notes/topic:fire

And this is the error I get: 

Fatal error: Call to a member function isErrorPage() on a non-object in C:xxxxkirbylibsite.php on line 97

I´m developing locally using WAMP.

Seems something URL related but I have no clue, any ideas?

thanks
