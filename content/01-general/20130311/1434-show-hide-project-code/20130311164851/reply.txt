Text: Yes, that is the plugin I'm using. It works great; the thumbnails toggle the div and it slides down nicely. However, when I use $page:

	<?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>

in the toggled div, I get the text for the page the project thumbnails are on, which is /projects.

When I use

	<?php echo kirbytext($project->text()) ?>

I get the text of the first thumbnail. 

I don't know how to use the code needed for projects.php, and at the same time the code for project.php on this single page. If I were to return all the different divs for all projects separately, there wouldn't be a problem. In that case, I could just create a link and toggled div for each of them. But since I'm using Kirby's php, I get stuck.
