Text: Hi!
I want to display different snippets (as a side panel) in pages witch have the same template, but I don't know if it's possible.
I tried this in template.php:

    <?php snippet('kirbytext($page->sidepanel())') ?>

with kirbytext in .txt file:

    Sidepanel:contact-panel

witch I though it would call the contact-panel.php snippet, but it does not work.

anyone have a better idea?
