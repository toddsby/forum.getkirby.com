Text: As a semi-solution to responsive images I used [Adaptive Images](http://adaptive-images.com) before in a Kirby project, but for the next one I'd prefer to use [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) by Scott Jehl. It's basically a polyfill for the proposed picture element.

Anyone here with experience implementing this with Kirby? What's your preferred method of doing this?

Thanks
