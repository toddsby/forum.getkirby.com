Text: Hey guys,

is it possible to temporarily hide/deactivate/unpublish a page with kirby? It shouldn't be shown or included in the search results, sitemap etc.

Since the `Ignore Content Files` don't allow a regular expression we couldn't use them. We also tried using a own template file `unpublished.de.md` to ignore it, but the folder (containing the ignored files) creates a navigation item anyway.

We think a prefix like XX-sitename to deactivate/unpublish a page, would probably be a smart feature. Or is there already another good way?

Thanks!
