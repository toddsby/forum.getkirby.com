Text: I bet you could easily make the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/thumb text: Thumb Plugin) work alongside (link: https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill text: Picturefill).

Picturefull is a shim to make the (link: http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/wiki/Picture_Element_Proposal text: proposed picture element) work now, so you can get those hi res images as well as appropriately sized responsive images.

Haven't tried this yet, but I think it should work.
