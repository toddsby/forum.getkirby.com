Text: Hi, 

I'm working on a website that has two different versions. All images on the page have two different sizes. 01.png and 01@2x.png. The following script shows the cover image:

    <img src="<?php echo $article->images()->find('01.png')->url(); ?>" />

But i want to show the 01@2x.png if the page is visited on a retina display. Is there any plugin that can replace all the images on a page with the @2x version?

Thanks,
