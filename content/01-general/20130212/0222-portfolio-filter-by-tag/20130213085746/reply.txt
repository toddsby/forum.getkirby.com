Text: Na, you don't need a separate page for the results. Just loop through the articles:

	<?php foreach($articles AS $article): ?>
		<h1><?php echo $article->title() ?></h1>
		<?php echo kirbytext($article->text()) ?>
	<?php endforeach ?>

You've made sure you're not using an old template or something like that?
