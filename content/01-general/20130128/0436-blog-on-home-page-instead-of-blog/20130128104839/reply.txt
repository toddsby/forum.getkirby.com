Text: In your **site** folder, in your **config.php** find and amend this bit:

```php
    /* 
    ---------------------------------------
    Homepage Setup
    ---------------------------------------
    By default the folder/uri for your homepage is "home".
    Sometimes it makes sense to change that to make your blog
    your homepage for example. Just change it here in that case.
    
*/
    c::set('home', 'home');


```

to something like


```php
    /* 
    ---------------------------------------
    Homepage Setup
    ---------------------------------------
    By default the folder/uri for your homepage is "home".
    Sometimes it makes sense to change that to make your blog
    your homepage for example. Just change it here in that case.
    
*/
    c::set('home', 'blog');
