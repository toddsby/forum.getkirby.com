Text: I don't think this works because you're trying to get one image from all children.

Instead, you need find the children pages, loop through them with the foreach, and then just get the image from each. Something like this:

```php
<section class="container">
  <div class="twelve columns offset-by-two">
    <div class="projets">
    <?php $children = $page->children() ?>
    <?php foreach ($children as $child): ?>
      <?php $articleimage = $child->images()->find('main.jpg') ?>
      <div style="background:url('<?php echo $articleimage->url() ?>');">
        <a href="<?php echo $page->nextVisible()->url() ?>" class="prochain"></a> 
      </div>
    <?php endforeach ?>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```
