Text: Thanks, I've checked the topic and I see that the fix that's in that topic is the exact same fix I'm mentioning above.

The problem with it is that I would have to change the kirbytext.php file every time I update Kirby. So I was hoping for a better solution, probably by writing a plugin. There's documentation on extending kirbytext.php as a plugin, but I'm not good enough at PHP to solve my problem.
