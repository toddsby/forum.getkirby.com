Text: There is a catch, though. If you have a folder with lots of items in it, the portal bogs down if you try to make a page visible and it doesn't end up dropping it in the place you tried to drop it.

The best workaround if you run into that is to just make it visible via the filesystem by renaming the folder with a number.
