Text: Hey guys,

I've been slowly learning PHP and trying to improve on my CSS and HTML skills whilst testing Kirby over the past month or two, on and off.

I've been wondering if you use something like simplecart.js (http://simplecartjs.org) to add Paypal functionality to your website, with kirby using text files would this still be an issue security wise if you used a database instead or would it be possible to use text files.

Its interesting to read on the documentation that you can use static html websites to display a product, would using Kirby with text files and this be a security issue?

Thanks

Chris
