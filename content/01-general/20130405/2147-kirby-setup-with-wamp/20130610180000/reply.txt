Text: @YeslmAaron - I'm hoping you may be able to throw some light on a similar problem that I have:
http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:694

I'm not using Apache, rather IIS but have the URL Rewrite module installed - it's just I don't know what rules to give it to help Kirby?
Any help appreciated,
Thanks,
J
