Text: Hello all,

Like many others it appears, I am having difficulties getting Kirby set up on my local machine.  I'm using WAMP. I've copied all of the files to my 'www' directory into a 'kirby' folder.  When I visit localhost/kirby the index page shows up fine.  It is when I click the nav links that the problem occurs.
