Text: Need a little bit of help here for a simple gallery section with a submenu and a subsubmenu for each category of the submenu.

to look like that 

*Mainmenu:*
home/ about/ gallery/ contact/
***
*in the gallery section:*
                gallery
***
*a submenu:*
			paintings			

				*a subsubmenu:*				
					2009
			photo
			drawing
***
the  objective is to get something like in the knowledge-base template or the styleguide.

painting: is a subfolder of the gallery folder
2009: is a subfolder of the painting folder

I have a specifique template for the painting folder to laod the treemenu snippet and show the 2009 folder.
But i cant get it to work properly, i get as output all the element of the menu.

well is a little bit of a mess, i hope someone will be able to understand, i'm still looking into the fun with menu tutorial but my understanding of php is quit limited

Thanks in advance.
