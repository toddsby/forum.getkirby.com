Text: I currently have 6 articles in company/news. The code below displays the first 5 posts, but not most recent. I want only the 5 most recent posts. I'm sure it's obvious... anyone?

```
<?php foreach($pages
	->find('company/news')
	->children()
	->visible()
	->limit(5)
	->sortBy($sort="date", $dir="desc") 
as $article): ?>
  // lists and stuff
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Thanks.
