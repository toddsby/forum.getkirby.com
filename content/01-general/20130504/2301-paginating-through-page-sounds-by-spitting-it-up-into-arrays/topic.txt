Text: I wondered what the best way is to paginate through a bunch of files. I have 100+ .mp3’s in a directory (a podcast, basically) and want to show 10 per page with pagination?

I’ve tried a bunch of different ways none have which have been even close to working.

I’m thinking:

set $page->sounds() as array

check querystring for ?showpage=2 

then use that to filter the array to just show .mp3 11-20

I’m getting nowhere… I tried this method — http://jfh.cc/P3Kw but it seems Kirby uses objects not arrays?
