Text: I just found this in the docs: 

```
$feed = new SimplePie();
$feed->set_feed_url('http://simplepie.org/blog/feed/');
$feed->set_cache_location($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/app/cache_files');
$feed->init();
...
```

So it means that you can set the cache location on runtime. In that case you should be able to use c::get('root.cache') to set the cache dir. 

Something like: 


```
$feed->set_cache_location(c::get('root.cache') . '/simplepie');
```

But you must make sure that the folder exists inside the cache dir and that it is writable. 

I hope this helps.
