Text: @loasca I never tried but it should work in the following way. 
Kirby supports additional language files, which will only be loaded for the current language. You can add specific language files like this: 

1. add a languages folder to your sites folder
2. add a language file for each language: 

```
site/languages/en.php
site/languages/de.php
```

In those files you can normally set global language variables like this: 

```
l::set('myvar', 'my content for var "myvar"');

```

The content of those variables can be used in your snippets and templates with `l::get('myvar')`

So what you can try to do is to put something like

```
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'en_US');
```

in those language files.
