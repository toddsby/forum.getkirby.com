Text: Sorry, compared to the tutorial, I was manually adding my own .dropdown-toggle class which was overriding the one generated by Kirby.

As soon as I moved ecco($item->isOpen() to my manually generated class like this it worked:
```
class="dropdown-toggle <? ecco($item->isOpen(), 'active') ?>"
```

Cheers
