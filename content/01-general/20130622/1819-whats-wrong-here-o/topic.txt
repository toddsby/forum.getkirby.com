Text: Hello,
i try to setup a local Kirby Page for testing something before i going to buy Kirby.

But i have a problem and i donÂ´t find a solution :/
I created a new visible Page and add a .txt file in the folder and created a .php template for this file but it does not work.

Here is a picture
