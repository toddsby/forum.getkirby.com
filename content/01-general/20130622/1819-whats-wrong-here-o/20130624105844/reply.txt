Text: For code Three (3) backticks - here is one ` 
to end and finish a code block on this forum, you can add identifiers after the first three backticks e.g. php, js or html etc. for syntax highlighting. 
Search this forum for more information.

e.g.
```php
<?php echo "echo this" ?>
```

The php loop in the example is for one image per `div`, but from the comments the Instagram object which is returned contains 10 shots. Is it not returning 10 shots? 

It would produce a series of `<div class="instagram-photo">`'s which you could float with CSS and make into rows or alter the PHP to produce some other HTML layout.
