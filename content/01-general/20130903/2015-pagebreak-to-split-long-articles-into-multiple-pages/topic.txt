Text: Hi,

I'd like to be able to split long articles into several without having to manually separate the file into multiple content files (like the <-nextpage-> tag in WP or pagebreak in Joomla).

Cannot code that myself, I'm afraid, so does anyone know of a plugin? Or is there a way to do that in Kirby that I have just overlooked?

Cheers
