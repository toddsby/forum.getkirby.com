Text: This is fantastic. I'm with you. I find Jade helps to keep everything DRY. 

It would be awesome if you could provide a short tutorial on how to incorporate this workflow. 

My current w/flow:
1. Create html templates (and all includes/mixins) in jade
2. Heavy use of css preprocessors: Less (now moving to sass)
3. Use the exported html templates and incorporate kirby php codes to generate the site templates
4. Break reusable html components into php includes

As you can see there are many redundant steps just to get things created. 

Please keep us upto date with your progress :)
