Text: I'm not here to say negative stuff about Wordpress. It's a fantastic system and definitely a good choice for many situations. 

But here are some arguments for Kirby:

Kirby is very flexible. You can actually build pretty much any site structure, your client is looking for very quickly. 

That means that it is also future-proof. If your client comes up with a new idea and wants to restructure/redesign the entire site, it's possible without ditching the entire system and starting from scratch. 

You can store any kind of data with Kirby. There's no limitation to the number or type of fields and content the clients can have on their site. 

As you already said, the performance is great out of the box and can be even better with enabled caching. The new <http://smashingconf.com> website is the best example, how well Kirby handles high amounts of traffic. We have caching disabled for it!! 

With the panel you get the best of both worlds. A flexible web interface, which your clients can use to edit and add content, plus a 100% synced version, which can be edited via FTP. This means that backups are super easy. You can make use of the advantages of FTP-programs to upload huge amounts of data instead of a slow web upload. The developer can stick to their favorite editor and FTP-programm to make changes more quickly. 

The flexible core of Kirby + the included Kirby toolkit make it easy to extend Kirby, even if there's no plugin yet. I think that it's more important for a developer to feel comfortable with extending a system than knowing that there are gazillions of plugins. Most of the time existing plugins won't fit 100% anyway and you have to build customized solutions for your clients. 

Even though Kirby is not free, the source is 100% available on Github and anyone can contribute and submit improvements. This also makes sure that you don't have to buy a system you can't really test and check if it's good or not. 

Kirby is backed by personal support. If you got questions, I'm always there to help and the forum is another great place to find answers to common issues. 

Even though Kirby is still a pretty young system, it has already been used for quite a lot of impressive, high-quality websites and has received fantastic feedback. 

Kirby is constantly growing and improving and new updates and releases are being published regularly. 

I hope this helps. 
If I find more arguments, I'm going to post them here :)
