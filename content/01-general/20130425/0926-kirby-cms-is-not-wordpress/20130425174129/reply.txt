Text: They are definitely very different.

To make any *changes* to a Kirby–built site, I would say HTML & CSS knowledge is required. PHP knowledge is extremely valuable, but you can hack you’re way around (I had next to none when I started using Kirby).

WordPress has a large theme base surrounding it, in which people can, basically, click a button and have an entirely new design. Although there are a few themes for Kirby floating around, the underlying system in place isn’t nearly as robust as WordPress. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.

I enjoy Kirby because it’s lightweight and more do–it–yourself via all these handy little helper functions.
