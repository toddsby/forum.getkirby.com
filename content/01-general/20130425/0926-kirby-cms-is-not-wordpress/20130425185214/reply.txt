Regarding security, I'm not really sure. Seems like it should be more secure, but I'm not entirely sure.

Regarding SEO, SEO doesn't depend on your CMS. It depends on your content. You can incorporate good SEO practices in any CMS. I would say Kirby is easier to do that with partly because it's easier to deal with custom fields, which come in handy for things like description meta tags.
