Text: Hi There,

We have a site tree that looks like this:

    |_Shop
      |_Sheets
        |_Sheet one
        |_Sheet two
      |_Bed spreads
        |_Bed spread one
        |_Bed spread two
      |_Duvet covers
        |_Duvet cover one
        |_Duvet cover two

When on sheets, how do we show the child pages of Bed spreads and Duvet covers but exclude the children of the current page, sheets?

At the moment we're doing it like this - but is there a way to exclude the current parent when we grab all visible children at the top of the snippet?

    <?php
      // grab all children of 'shop'
      $items = $pages->findByUID('shop')->children()->visible();

      // only output if there are items to display
      if($items->count() > 0) :
    ?>

    <div class="box box-filigree">
      <div class="box-image">
        <div id="slider-recommended" class="owl-carousel">

        <?php foreach($items as $item) :

          // get all visible children
          $children = $item->children()->visible();

          // return a boolean to determine if the child will be in an open tree
          $openChild = $item->isOpen();

            // if child has children & the child is not open
            if(($children->count() > 0) && (!$openChild)) :
          ?>

            <? foreach($children as $child) : ?>
              <? if($child->hasImages()) : $image = $child->images()->first(); ?>
                <div class="item">
                  <a href="<?= $child->url(); ?>" alt="<?= $child->title(); ?>"><img src="<?= thumb($image, array('width' => 500), false); ?>" alt="<?= $child->title(); ?>"><h6><?= $child->title(); ?></h6></a>
                </div>
              <? endif ?>
            <?php endforeach ?>
          <?php endif ?>
        <?php endforeach ?>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <?php endif ?>

Also, does Kirby have something like Ultimate Parent which would travel up the tree to one level below the home page? 

That way we won't have to specify the parent and could put this onto any page such as a news category page.
