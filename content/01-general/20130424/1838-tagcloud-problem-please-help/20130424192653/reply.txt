Text: Yes, I want them to be the same or have something similar. Please note that I am a complete noob in CSS coding. All I know is that in Wordpress I can have Categories or Tags displayed on the right side of the website. 

In Kirby, I can use tags to achieve similar results but I have no idea how to make them as visual as they are on the Kirby website.

Can you please show me what I need to do to make TagCloud visually appealing?
