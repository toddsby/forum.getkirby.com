Text: Now you have two opening `ul` elements in your HTML (default.php file). In the GitHub Gist I sent, the red highlighted line is what I *removed or changed* and the green highlighted line is what it was changed to.

Remove line 7, keep line 8.

Everyone has to start somewhere and I was once in the same position as you, but this is *very* basic HTML knowledge. I would suggest learning HTML and CSS before diving into Kirby.
