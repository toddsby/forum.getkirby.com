Text: Got it. I did not know that the themes were different. I thought that it was just a matter of copying the right code from this website. 

I wonder if the tags function will be better implemented in in Kirby 2 because logically, what the official site has should be easily available in the code.

I'll play around with Kirby a bit more to see if it works for me. 

Thank you for all your help.
