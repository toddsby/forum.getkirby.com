Text: I have tried to follow the tutorial about setting up tags and the tagcloud pluging.

So far I have:

1. Added the tagcloud.php to the plugin folder

2. Added tagcloud code to my default.php template but I am not sure it is in the right place. This is how it looks - <http://pastebin.com/3vFsBHPT>

Results:

This is how tagcloud looks on my site - <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/184602/TagCloud%20Problem.jpg>

But this is how it looks on Kirby website - <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/184602/TagCloud%20Working.jpg>

How do I make tags work just like on Kirby website?
