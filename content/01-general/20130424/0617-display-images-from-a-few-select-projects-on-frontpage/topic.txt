I'm wanting to display a particular image from only a few select projects on the frontpage. I can get it working to display the image from every project, but I'm wanting to chain just 5 projects as featured. Here's my current code:

    <? foreach($pages->children()->visible()->shuffle()->limit(1) as $project): ?>
        <figure>
            <a href="<?= $project->url() ?>"><img class="grayscale" src="<?= $project->files()->find('frontpage.jpg')->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($project->title()) ?>" /></a>
        </figure>
  <?php endforeach ?>

Any help would be awesome.
