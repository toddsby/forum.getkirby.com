Text: The only things that I changed in the original CSS are:

body
  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  width: 700px;

Current CSS - http://pastebin.com/UsQPxrCF
Current Config.php - http://pastebin.com/FX0tMbwb 

I think there is a markdown bug in the original CSS or config that causes no line break after bullets even thought there is one in the original markdown text.
