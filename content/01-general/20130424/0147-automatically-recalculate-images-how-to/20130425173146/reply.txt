Text: max-width is determined by the resolutions of the screen on which the website is being viewed? 

If I use the code above, the images on my site scale out of proportion relative to the template of the site. But if I use something like

     img {
     max-width: 700px;
     }

Images are scaled according to the width of my text body width. However, based on what you said above, this is not effective because it is not responsive.
