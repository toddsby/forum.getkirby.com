Thanks for the help! 

That makes sense. I'm just having a little trouble implementing it… Just to be clear, inside each page's folder, there is a /detail subfolder. In other words, I want to target the /detail folder inside each page in my /projects folder. So for example: 

**content/03-projects/01-project-1/detail
content/03-projects/02-project-2/detail**
etc…

So in other words, how can I target the relative subfolder for each page, rather than a specific /detail folder (i.e. carousel/detail)? 

I have tried various ways of making this code work:

	<?php $imagepage = $pages->find('carousel/detail') ?>
	<?php $images = $imagepage->images() ?>				
	<?php $n=0; foreach($page->images() as $image): $n++; ?>

but I keep getting error messages. E.g.:

	Fatal error: Call to a member function images() on a non-object

Amy I doing something wrong here? Does $page->images() only work with the $page variable (and not custom variables such as $imagepage ?)

Again, thanks so much for all your help. Any suggestions appreciated!
