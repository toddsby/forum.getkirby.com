Text: I just got back from (link: http://2013.realtimeconf.com text: RealTimeConf popup: yes) and learned a lot about the IndieWeb movement. I don't know much programming but am interested in POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), specifically for Twitter. 

Has anyone else done much with this? Would anyone be interested in building an add-on for Kirby? Here's some great info from the (link: http://indiewebcamp.com/Twitter#How_to text: IndieWebCamp popup: yes). It's over my head but it seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to do...

Thoughts?
