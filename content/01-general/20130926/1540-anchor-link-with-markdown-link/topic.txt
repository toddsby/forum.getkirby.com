Text: Hello,

I am building a singlepage with different sections.

Now I have some links from one section to the other via href="#anchor" trying to write it in Markdown with (link: anchor), but I don't get the right html out of it.

How can I get that working? Hope, this question is not too stupid, but by now I have no idea of a solution...

Best,
Mario
