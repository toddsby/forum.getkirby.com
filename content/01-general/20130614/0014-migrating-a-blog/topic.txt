Text: I'm working on a couple websites and so far am enjoying Kirby.
Now I'm at a fork in the road.
One of my websites has a blog, currently run on Blogger.
Has anyone migrated a currently existing blog into Kirby? How easy is it? Has anyone imported from Blogger, specifically.

Any suggestions, opinions, advice would be _deeply_ appreciated!

Thanks!
Sarah
