Text: Hey again @hey_stephen and @bastianallgeier,

With the children()->children() I am able to fetch the content now. But pagination is still a problem. 

What I am trying to do is the total there should be 5 pages (parent + children + grandchildren), can you please give suggestions for nesting the pagination?

thanks, 
prayas
