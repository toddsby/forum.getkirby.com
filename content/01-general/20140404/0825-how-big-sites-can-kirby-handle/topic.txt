Text: **How many pages on a site can Kirby handle with good result?**

 - I know the length of the txt files matter. Lets say they are about 550 words.
 - I know that the server matter.
 - I know that the code inside the PHP matter.
 - I know there is a cache when needed.

Still it should be able to give a hint of what number of pages Kirby can handle.

100? 1000? 10 000? 100 000? 1 miljon? 10 miljon?

How many pages do YOU have on your Kirby site? With or without cache? How does it go?

I have about 80 pages so far without cache. It goes fine.
