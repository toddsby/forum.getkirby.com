Text: I have about 1,000 pages just in my blog folder. Not really sure beyond that. Over 500 at least.

I have Kirby cached, as well as behind a load balancer that does some caching itself. I have it balanced across four different servers, which is super easy to do with Kirby. 

I'm doing some things on the blog overview page that made me have to increase my memory allotment for PHP, but I haven't seen a performance hit from any of it.

It would seem to me that a bigger concern than raw number of pages would be how many different pages you're pulling data from at the same time, but I could be wrong. I'll show you some of the weird things I'm doing with Kirby, and then you can maybe decide if it fits your needs.

1. (link: http://www.joyent.com/partners)

    I'm pulling data from partners (only about 45 of them) as well as from related partners. I think I'm actually pulling the partners more than once to get different data, when I should probably just be looping through the same variable multiple times, so I probably didn't make it very efficiently, but it seems to perform well.

2. (link: http://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design)

    The subnav on these pages is actually created by reading in the entire sibling pages and processing out the headers with IDs to create links to them. Just a PHP function, not so much a Kirby function, but I haven't run into any issues.

3. (link: http://www.joyent.com/products/compute-service/pricing)

    With this one, it's not actually pulling much Kirby data. PHP is pulling info from a json file, so I guess it's not so much dependent on Kirby, but again, no issues mixing that all in.

4. (link: http://www.joyent.com/blog)

    As I mentioned before, the blog has almost 1,000 pages. I'm pulling the pages more than once to filter for different things (checking for featured items, checking for featured Node.js items, etc). I'm also pulling items from the events page. Pay no attention to the fact that it's empty. There are no events right now. Todo: put in a check to only display that if there are events. I also need to fix that customer tile where someone forgot to include a logo.

    Again, as I'm learning more there are probably more efficient ways I could have built this page, but everything seems to work well. I'm also using a (link: http://fitzage.com/articles/kirby-plugin-for-latest-non-future-items text: plugin I created) for some of this page.

    I assume the pagination limits what Kirby has to deal with on this page, so that probably helps.

So far, I haven't noticed anything I've done making Kirby any slower than normal. Can't tell you what it would be like with 10,000 pages, but you're not normally going to be accessing all those pages at once anyway.

Hope this helps.
