Text: I played around a bit with all the git tools available and figured out a way that could work:

1. I forked the original repository of kirbycms which allows me to apply (cross-project) changes to the source. The fork can be upgraded/updated anytime the original kirbycms repository changes using git pull (--rebase).

2. For a new web project using kirbycms I can now clone the custom repository and add my contents, templates and assets. Once I want to upgrade the cms of a project to the latest version I can fetch the remote branch and merge them again.

At least that workflow worked for my small test project, but maybe I am over-complicating the whole process... 

@fitzage Your approach is way more target-oriented and has the advantage that it does not clutter the version history of the actual project. 

Maybe I have to over-think my attempt. Nonetheless I would be still interested in further comments about proven KirbyCMS/Git workflows.
