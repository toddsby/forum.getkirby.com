Text: Hey,
I currently setup a web project using kirby cms. In order to make updating the system a breeze I wonder how you would setup the project using git? Unfortunately I am new to git (currently switching from subversion) and still struggling with some of its concepts.

Basically I want the project to allow for the following:
1. Incorporate changes from the official kirby cms dev branch.
2. Customize the core of the kirby cms/toolkit
3. Customize site content/assets/config

So how would I start? Simply clone the kirbycms repository and change the files I want to modify? But how would I commit my changes to my own repository then? Should I instead include kirbycms as submodule? What is your git-workflow for a kirbycms powered site?

Quite confusing for me as a git-starter...

Greetings,
Daniel
