Is it possible to find out the available languages of the current page, and also get a reference to the page object for those pages?

I'm building a site with two languages, Swedish and English, but not all pages will be available in both languages. What I would like to do is to, somewhere on the page, offer a link to the current page in the other language, if available. If not available I would instead like to link to the home page of the page in the other language.

If it is possible, I would also like to be able to get the title of the page in the other language so I could make the link text something like "Read this in English: About the company" when visiting the page "Om f√∂retaget" in Swedish, and vice versa.

Is there some way I can do this?
