Text: It's never easy to answer that sort of question because it really depends on many factors.

The main advantage of Kirby - in my opinion - is that you get a lightweight, flexible and easy to understand and to use CMS that helps you to create the sort of website that you want the way you want it.

While Wordpress and other CMS come with a lot of heavy overweight (like a lot of js-files) that covers all sorts of use cases, Kirby is rather basic in a very positive sense of the word. Its up to you to decide what sort of functionality you want to add to it.

While there are a few "themes" around that you may use - if only as a starting point - the idea is rather to create your own templates. And doing so is not really that difficult with a basic knowledge of PHP and the help of the tutorials on the [Kirby Website](http://getkirby.com).

You can also easily combine Kirby with frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation, or use it in conjunction with grid systems like semantic.gs to help you create a responsive website. And of course add all sort of functionality using jquery or whatever.

Having said that, Wordpress certainly has the advantage of having a large community that contributes thousands of plugins that make adding all sort of additional functionality very easy. Certainly a plus if you are not a programmer and want to implement that sort of functionality into your website.

If you don't, Kirby is much easier to adapt to your needs than a system like Wordpress. And since Kirby is free to try you might as well download and install it and follow the tutorials to check if you can make it work.
