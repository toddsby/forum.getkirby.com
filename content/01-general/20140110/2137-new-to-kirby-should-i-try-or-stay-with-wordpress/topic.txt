Text: Hi, I am not a programmer. I am a designer/illustrator and I have been using Wordpress for my past two websites since 2009. I am looking to create a new website for my work. After some research I found Kirby. The examples of website that are showcased are really nice, fresh and responsive.
I am not sure where to start! Should I hire and pay someone? Is Kirby so small that it's hard to find someone? About future maintenance?
I am not understanding the process or Kirby.
Could someone point at me some tutorial for dummies?!
Thanks in advance!
