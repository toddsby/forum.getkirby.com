Text: I am trying to create editable text blocks for sidebar or page blocks that can be inserted just like the snippet() function, but also editable using *.txt for variables.

But this block content should not be accessible directly like the pages (should I use .htaccess to restrict it?).

How do you pull this off in Kirby?


Thanks!
