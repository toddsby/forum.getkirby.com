Text: Wondering if it'd be possible to store generated thumbnails in separate directories (by uid, or path, etc).

i.e.

on page:
site/page-1

the thumbs would be stored in:
site/thumbs/page-1

Since the thumbs don't have any recognizable filenames, if you want to clean up thumbs if you re-arrange or remove a section, there isn't anyway to track them down.

Thanks!
