Text: Just saw your post here (kinda accidentally). I couldn't find any mails sent by you in our (new) support system. 

But anyway... have you already considered a (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/multi-environment-setup text: multi-environment setup)? That could do the trick for you, although it's hard for me to solve your issue without having access to your code/setup. But you should definitely give it a try. 

And please check the RewriteBase in your (live server's) `.htaccess` as well! 

If you've set it locally to

```
RewriteBase /your-awesome-project
```

the live version has to be

```
RewriteBase /
```

(At least if your project folder isn't a subfolder of your domain's root.)
