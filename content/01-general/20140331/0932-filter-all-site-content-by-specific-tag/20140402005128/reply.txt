Text: I can get pages to show in the first level folders but nothing from deeper folders.

Example:

folder 1 > folder 2 > folder 2 page
folder 1 > folder 2 > folder 3> folder 3 page

I am trying to list pages no matter the folder depth that have the tag I define.

I can't figure out how to go past the "folder 2" level.
