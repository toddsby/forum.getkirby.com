I figured it out

Funny enough it was the [Drafts](http://getkirby.com/blog/drafts) tutorial that gave me the right direction.

Here is the working code.

    <?php $deals = $pages->index() ?>
    <?php foreach($deals AS $p): ?>
        <?php if($p->deal() == 'yes'): ?>
            <a href="<?php echo $p->url() ?>">Test</a>
    <?php endif ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>
