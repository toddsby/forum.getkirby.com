Text: is there a way to filter every page in the entire site instead of a specific folder.

I am trying to add items to my homepage that have a specific tag but the pages could be in any folder, i.e ecommerce site that filters to the from page anything with a tag "deal".

Here is my current code:

    <?php $article = $pages->filterBy('tags', 'deal'); ?>

    <?php foreach($article as $p): ?>`
    <article>
      <h1><?php echo kirbytext($p->title()) ?></h1>
      <p><?php echo excerpt($p->text(), 300) ?></p>
      <a href="<?php echo $p->url() ?>">Read moreâ€¦</a>
    </article>

    <?php endforeach ?>
