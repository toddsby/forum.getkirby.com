Text: I'd like to be able to inset an image or figure through kirbytext without paragraph tags or line breaks being added around, or inserted between, lines while using kirbytext.

For example:

    (figure: picture1.jpg)
    (figure: picture2.jpg)

Should turn into:

    <figure>...</figure>
    <figure>...</figure>

Currently it does not, it instead changes to:

    <figure>...</figure>
    <br>
    <figure>...</figure>

Or if I place an extra line break, it adds multiple empty paragraphs between them.

I've looked at a [few](http://getkirby.com/forum/issue-tracker/topic:16) [topics](http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:261) including the following but none resolve the issue:

I'm also using the [kirbytext extension](https://gist.github.com/tysongach/4338482) for figures.

Any help would be appreciated.
