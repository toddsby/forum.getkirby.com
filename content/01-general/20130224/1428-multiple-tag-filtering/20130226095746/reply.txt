Text: There are a few ways to approach this, either do it live, your data  updates as and when people select things. Or secondly they pre-select their options and then they click 'search' and you go and get there data. Depends of the size and complexity of your dataset.

How are you doing your 'Month' and 'Country' cloud? In some cases it might be better attaching the Date and Country to the actual page rather than a Tag? You could then use 'filterby' or something similar and use the cloud for tags?
