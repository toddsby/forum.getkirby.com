Text: I got an e-mail response from Bastian so I just post that here:

I think the best way to set this up is with a different "in" parameter: 

$in = get('in') == 'printwork' ? 'printwork' : 'digital';

$search = new search(array(
'searchfield' => 'search',
'in' => 'files/' . $in
));


That way you can have a query parameter in your URL, which can switch where to search: 

http://yourdomain.com/search/?in=printwork...
http://yourdomain.com/search/?in=digital...

I hope this helps
