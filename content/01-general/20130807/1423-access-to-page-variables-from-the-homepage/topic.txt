Text: Hi folks, I'm trying to build a snippet to feature a special page on the homepage.

The user write the uid of the page in the textfield in the Panel, and I want Kirby to retrieve the image and the text from this page.

I made [this](http://pastebin.com/s17vMQqP) but it's not working. I have no idea how to retrieve the page informations. The page set for featuring in the panel can be visible or invisible and anywhere in the content folder, including sub-folders.
