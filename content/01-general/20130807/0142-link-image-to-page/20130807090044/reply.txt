Text: So if we're in the post listing page template, and each post is a child of this page, and has an image file, you could use the following:

	<!-- Loops through all the children -->
	<?php foreach($page->children() as $child): ?>

		<!-- Gets the URL of the child page -->
		<a href="<?php echo $child->url() ?>">

			<!-- Gets the first image of the child page, and its title -->
			<img src="<?php echo $child->images()->first()->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $child->images()->first()->name() ?>" />

		</a>

	<?php endforeach ?>
	<!-- Ends Loop -->


There could be a neater way to do this, I'm still new to this myself. 
If you want, you could set a title for image and use that instead of the name() I stuck in there for the alt tag.
