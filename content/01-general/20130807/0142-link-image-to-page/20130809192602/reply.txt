Text: http://getkirby.com/blog/text-formatting-101 has examples of how to link images from within kirbytext.

There's information here about how to search for images based on filename in an extension agnostic fashion: http://getkirby.com/blog/1-1-1 (might also be in the docs, but I'm not sure. It was added in Kirby 1.1.1.)
