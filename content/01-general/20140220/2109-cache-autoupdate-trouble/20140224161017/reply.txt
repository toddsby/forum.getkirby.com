Text: A note of clarification: removing all of the files from the cache does, as expected, cause pages to be re-cached as they're visited. Proof again that the initial caching of a page is working. I'd hate to turn off caching all together, since there is a considerable performance boost, but I can't keep it running if updates are never, well, updated. :)
