Text: The content folder (and its contents) in my Kirby installation is accessible by going to example.com/content. I get the Apache file listing of that folder.

.txt files redirect to /error as defined in the default root .htaccess, but the actual file listing is still there.

Is there a way to stop this? Some kind of .htaccess modification?

I tried searching for a similar problem, but I was unable to find anything.

Thanks!
