Text: As far as I know, I don't think that is possible without hacking the core Kirby files.

Maybe there are other ways to achieve what you're up to but that's difficult to decide not knowing what the rest of the site is like.

One idea would be to use YAML in a text file instead of using the language variables.

Like

    Variables:
        mybutton:
            English: my button
            Deutsch: Mein Button
        anotherbutton:
            English: another button
            Deutsch: ein anderer Button
