Text: I know there is probably something like an if statement to solve this problem, but I can't seem to integrate it correctly. I basically want this code to be passed over if there aren't any images in the content folder. Any ideas?

<?php foreach($article->images() as $img): ?>
  <li><img src="<?php echo $img->url() ?>" /></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
