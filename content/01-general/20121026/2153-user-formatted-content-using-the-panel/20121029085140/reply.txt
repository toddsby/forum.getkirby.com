Text: Fitzage I cannot help thinking that WYSIWYG is perhaps getting away from the spirit of Kirby and the lovely Markdown ideas? There are of course already minimal buttons and I feel extending these could be the best way forward?

I, for one, would like to see a internal website page selector for linking to internal pages (there is a link for http based pages) and maybe some of these be available for file fields as well, so you can say link images to internal pages.

What sort of things are you after?
