Text: I agree with the sentiment that a WYSISYG editor like TinyMCE (the one WordPress uses) would destroy the mindset and real charm Kirby has. It would be a step backwards.

Markdown is powerful and with Kirbytext, it becomes *really* powerful.

I think with the addition of a few key buttons for text fields (or the ability to create our own, for when we extend Kirbytext) would be beneficial. As well as the creation of a repeatable field.

Maybe even a preview panel, ala this (link: http://john.onolan.org/ghost/#fulloverlay text: Ghost concept).
