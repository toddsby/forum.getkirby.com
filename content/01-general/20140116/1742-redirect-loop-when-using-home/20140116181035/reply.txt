Text: home(); actually redirects to the homepage instead of displaying the link to it. If you include this on every page, e.g. through a header snippet, it will be executed every time you open a page. This will indeed result in a redirect loop. Use

<pre>&lt;?php echo url('/'); ?&gt;</pre>

for displaying a link instead.
