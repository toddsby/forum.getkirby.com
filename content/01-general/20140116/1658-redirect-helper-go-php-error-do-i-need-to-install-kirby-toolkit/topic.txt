Text: I need to redirect a subpage to other website such as "http://www.google.com", so I tried go(); function, had an error "Header has been sent by..." Also "go()" is not defined. Do I need the toolkit in order to use this helper?

Anyone can show me an example of successful redirecting? I'm in MAMP environment so far. And how to use kirby toolkit?

Any thoughts will be appreciated!
