Text: You may need a better find command. This is what I'm doing to pull items from /articles into my homepage:

    <?php $articles = $pages->find('articles'); ?>
    <?php foreach($articles->children()->visible() as $article): ?>

etc, etc

Maybe you left off $pages-> before find?

Also if your "work" folder is more than one level deep, you need to include the full path.
