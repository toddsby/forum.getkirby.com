Text: I can't see a helper, doesn't mean to say there isn't one? Bastian maybe able to help here:

You could of course do something like:

```php

#http://www.foo.bar/foobar/foo
<?php echo $articles->url(); ?>

#foobar/foo
<?php echo $articles->uri(); ?>

#foo
<?php echo end(explode('/', $article->uri())); ?>

```
