Text: Hi,
I have added an textfield at the panel for article tags.
Now I want to have an multipleselect-dropdown witch have all my tags inside so that i have only to select the needed.
For this I have copied the the normal selected folder in panel>fields
added a multiselect.config.php with

	<?php $options['value'] = str::split($options['value']);

and changed the sourcecode to

	<select name="<?php echo $name ?>" class="<?php echo $class ?>" multiple="true"><?php foreach($options AS $key => $text): ?><option<?php if($key == $value) echo ' selected="selected"' ?>value="<?php echo html($key) ?>"><?php echo html($key) ?></option><?php endforeach ?></select>

and in the blueprint file I used type: multiselect. This work fine.
But now my problem is that it doesnÂ´t store the selection if i reload the article at the panel and at the article txt-file will only save the first selected tag and not all who i have select.
Can anyone tell me how can I fix my problems?
