Text: @Russ - I believe you are right, but I didn't know if there was an easy hack to make it look deeper. Your solution makes sense if you are filtering within the page itself. What I need is a way to filter every photo from all pages. In my case, I'm looking at upwards of maybe 30,000 images by the end of the year.

I may just need to break down and have the images indexed in mySQL for the tag cloud. Just what I didn't want to have to doâ€¦
