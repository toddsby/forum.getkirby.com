Text: Nathaniel, to now sort by tags you can just changes these bits: 

(I'm using the same station example as above, so you might want to change the variable names if you use it and also I've added some extra tags for some stations - just to show how it works.)

Lets change:

```php
$stations = $page->children()->visible(); 
```

to the following to get our tab index

```php
$tagindex = $pages->find('stations');
$stations = tagcloud($tagindex, array('sort' => 'name','sortdir'  => 'asc'));
```

then just change
```php
      $temp = explode(' ',$station->title());
```
to the tag name, there is not station->title in the tab index.

```php
     $temp = explode(' ',$station->name());
```

And because of this we will also have to change our output code a little to:

```php
<?php foreach($station as $stationName): ?>
        <li><a href="<?php echo $stationName->url()?>"><?php echo $stationName->name(). " - #". $stationName->results() ?></a></li>
<?php endforeach ?>
```
I've also added added the number of stations with the tag: $stationName->results()

Which gives you:

```html
<h4>C</h4>
  <ul class="stations listing">
            <li><a href="stations/tag:Cafe">Cafe - #3</a></li>
            <li><a href="stations/tag:Car Park">Car Park - #2</a></li>
        </ul>
 <hr/>
<h4>D</h4>
  <ul class="stations listing">
            <li><a href="stations/tag:Disabled Access">Disabled Access - #5</a></li>
        </ul>
 <hr/>
<h4>T</h4>
  <ul class="stations listing">
            <li><a href="stations/tag:Toilet">Toilet - #4</a></li>
        </ul>
 <hr/>
```

or

####C

+ Cafe - #3
+ Car Park - #2

####D

+ Disabled Access - #5

####T

+ Toilet - #4

Let us dance and be merry, I promise never to do another 'Alphabetti Spaghetti Stations' example again, OK maybe just one more...
