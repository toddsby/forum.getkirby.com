Text: I'm building a portfolio for a designer friend of mine. Therefore I defined the "work" page as homepage in config.php like so:

	c::set('home', 'work');

Now, when I visit the site, it won't append the "/work" to the URL.

You can see a live example of what I'm trying to achieve by visiting (link: http://frankchimero.com/ text: **frankchimero.com**). Do you notice how the URL instantly changes to (link: http://frankchimero.com/work/ text: **http://frankchimero.com/work/**)?

Is there any way to replicate this behaviour with Kirby?
