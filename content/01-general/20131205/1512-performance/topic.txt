Text: I have a project coming up that i want to use Kirby for, the website would be kinda like a business directory holding an advert for more than 500 separate companies. 

I'm curious as to what the performance would be like, Each page would only consist of a few images and few links.

Just for the record there would be no search features on the website so search performance isn't really an issue for users.

Any info would be appreciated,
