Text: Side Note: It's a lot easier to load balance Kirby than to load balance a database-backed system, in my opinion. You're only dealing with web servers, not database servers. Although I'm sure you could set up WordPress in a way that's load balanced, it needs quite a bit more work than with Kirby.

Of course that's the least of my issues with WordPressâ€¦

I inherited a project in WordPress that someone else had screwed up. Thankfully, I had good reasons to justify rebuilding it completely in Kirby. I think it may have taken less time than fixing what they screwed up in WordPress.
