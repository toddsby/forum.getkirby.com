Text: Hi forum, 

I set up pagination for my site but when I open page:1 I get an 310 error saying there are too many redirects.

page:2 displays fine.

I have no idea what caused this, when I tested it before it worked fine. I have since added other things to the site but never went back to testing if the pagination still worked so unfortunately, I can't go back to when it still worked.

If you have any suggestions I'd really like to hear them.

Thanks!
