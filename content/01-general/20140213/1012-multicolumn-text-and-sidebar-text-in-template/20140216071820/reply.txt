Text: Well with the setup I suggested, you can't hide the HTML if the field is empty. But I can't imagine why you'd want that column empty if that's how you're setting up the template. 

In that instance you could set up an additional template with just one column, and the user can select whichever template they want to use when creating the page. 

Hope that helps.
