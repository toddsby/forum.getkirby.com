Text: I don't understand. It's just standard html/css, with the kirby fields echoed inside them:

```php
<div id="content">
    <?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>
</div>
<div id="sidebar">
    <?php echo kirbytext($page->sidebar()) ?>
</div>
```

Then you set the width of each column in CSS and float them. Easy peasy.

If you want the sidebar background to go top to bottom, you probably need to make it a two-tone body background image. That's still the easiest way.

Of course usually your sidebar won't have content that's custom for each page, or won't completely be content that's custom for each page, so you'd generate a list of links in your sidebar snippet or some such.
