Text: My sidebar has content that's different for each product page.
@fitzage... okay...... I found my stupidity in there thanks to you!!
It's a little but important detail missing in the docs. kirbytext starts every accessor methos lowercase. But attributes in the text files in content/ can have lowercase or uppercase, it doesn't matter. There is no note of that anywhere.. 

 1. I wrongly used
```php 
    <?= kirbytext($page->Sidebar()) ?>
``` instead of  
```php 
    <?= kirbytext($page->sidebar()) ?>
```
2. I have had
```markdown 
Text:
----
Column 1 text. Column 1 text. Column 1 text. Column 1 text. 
Column 2 text. Column 2 text. Column 2 text. Column 2 text.

Sidebar:
----
* News
* Blog
```
but I should have used:
```markdown 
Text:
Column 1 text. Column 1 text. Column 1 text. Column 1 text. 
Column 2 text. Column 2 text. Column 2 text. Column 2 text.
----

Sidebar:
* News
* Blog
----
```

Just changed that little and it worked.
