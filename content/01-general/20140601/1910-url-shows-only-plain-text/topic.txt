Text: I tried uploading the files from the latest kirby release (1.1.2-29-g1cd95de) to my server, but it only shows the content of the index.php as plain text.

Finding out that my hosting-package at 'hosteurope' doesn't support .htaccess files, but mod_rewrite ist always anabled i tried to edit the config.php to 
c::set('rewrite', false);
and set the URL manually, but that didn't help.
I am not using a subfolder or anything.
Setting it up on a WAMP-Server is no problem and works fine.
Hope someone can help :)
