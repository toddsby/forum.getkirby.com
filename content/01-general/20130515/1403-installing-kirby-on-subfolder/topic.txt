Text: Hi,

I've just downloaded the package and installed on my server via FTP.

I've uploaded kirby files in a new folder: /web.

Then I created a .htaccess file with following rules:


> RewriteEngine On
> RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /web/$1


The .htaccess file is located in the root.

Then I modified the config.php:

>c::set('url', 'http://mywebsite.com/web');
>c::set('subfolder', 'web');

I got a 500 Internal Server Error when loading http://mywebsite.com

Where am I wrong?

Thanks
