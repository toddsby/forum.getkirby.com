Text: For a variety of reasons I have to use html in my text file for a page and in that html I need to include an image from the 'assets/images/' folder. so, I have something like this:

    <li><img src="assets/images/foo.png"> lorem ...</li>

But that doesn't work because it resolves to a location something like:
   http://localhost/kirbyness/index.php/foopage/assets/images/person-red.png

I can fix this by making the src attribute absolute, but then I'd need to change it when I move the site to a different domain. Also, I can't use the ( image: ... ) kirby text because the image is inside another block level bit of html ... and , finally, I can't just create a template for this bit (for a variety of reasons)

Any suggestions, or are there some things I've not considered that I am missing?

Many many thnks
