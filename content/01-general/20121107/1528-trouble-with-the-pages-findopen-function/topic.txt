Text: I have a page structure like this

```
01-section-1
	01-sub_section-1
	02-sub_section-2
02-section-1
	01-sub_section-1
	02-sub_section-2
```

and the following code at the beginning of my content snippet

```
$sections = $site->pages()->visible();
$current_section = $sections->findOpen();
$sub_sections = ($current_section) ? $current_section->children()->visible() : false;
$current_sub_section = $sub_sections->findOpen();
```

When I set the home page in the `config.php` file to a `section` page it works fine, but if I set the home page to `section/sub_section` I get a PHP error for the last line of the code above, telling me

```
Fatal error: Call to a member function findOpen() on a non-object
```

I'm probably missing something here but I can't figure it out...
