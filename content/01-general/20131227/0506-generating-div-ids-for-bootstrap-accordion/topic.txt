Text: Hi there,

First go-round with Kirby and php, and I'm crashing into a little wall here. What I want to do is create a set of accordion panels showing a project title in the heading and its description in its inner panel. The first level displays fine but as soon as I introduce php calls the accordion functionality stops working. I presume this is because I don't know how to assign the div IDs dynamically to enable the action. I've tried it a bunch of different ways and as a newbie am now totally stumped. Here's the best-looking example I've created for my purposes. That div id for class="accordion-body" is the likely place to start.

<pre>
<code>
    <span class="text">
    "<?php 
    $items = $page->children()->visible();
    if($items->count() > 0): 
    ?>
    
    <div class="accordion" id="accordion1">
    	<?php foreach($items as $item): ?>
    	<div class="accordion-group">
        <div class="accordion-heading">
          <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-    parent="<?php echo $id ?>" href="#collapse_<?php echo $id ?>">
          <?php echo html($item->title()) ?>
          </a>
        </div>
        <div id="collapse_<?php echo $id ?>" class="accordion-body collapse">
          <div class="accordion-inner">
          <?php echo html($item->text()) ?>
          </div>
        </div>
        <?php endforeach ?>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <?php endif ?>"
    </span>
    </code>
    </pre>
