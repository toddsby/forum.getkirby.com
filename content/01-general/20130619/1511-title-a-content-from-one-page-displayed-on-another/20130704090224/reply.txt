Text: I try to show the calender-plugin events on two sites  (home and event-site)
On the event site, it works fine for me, but it dosn't on the homepage.
Here is my code:

//call calendar plugin
calendar(yaml($page->events()), $options, 'div');

//read entrys form termine.txt
$events = $pages->find('termine')->children()->visible()

//show events
foreach ($events AS $event) : 
...    
endforeach 


Output is: "No entry." - but of cause, in termine.txt there are some events defined...
