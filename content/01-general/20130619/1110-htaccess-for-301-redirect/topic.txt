Text: Hi guys,

I'm currently looking for a solution that will redirect a specific folder(before Kirby install) to a new folder(after kirby install)

I'd like to make the following example work

    http://url.com/articles/articleName/ --> http://url.com/articles/category/article-name/

Thank you in advance
