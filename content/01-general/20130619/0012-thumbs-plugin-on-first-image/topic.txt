Text: Hi folks,

I'm trying to add the thumbs plugin to a for each loop of images attached to a page, but only retrieving the first.

     <?php foreach($work->images()->first() as $featured_image): ?>
          <?php echo thumb($featured_image, array('width' => 800)) ?>
     <?php endforeach ?>

This is what I had previously before adding the thumbs plugin...

     <img src="<?php echo $work->images()->first()->url() ?>" width="<?php echo $work->images()->width() ?>"/>

Any ideas? If I remove the ->first(), it works perfectly but obviously returns all the images; whereas I only need the first.
