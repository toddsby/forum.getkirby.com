Text: I don't understand well your question but try this:

	<?php thumb($work->images()->first(), array('width' => 800)) ?>

The thumb plugin must generate the img tag by default, but if you only want to get the URL of the generated thumb, you must pass a `false` for the third attribute of `thumb()` function as follow:


	<?php 
	
	$tnURL = thumb($work->images()->first(), array('width' => 800), false);
	echo $tnURL;
	
	?>

I hope this work for you :)
