Text: I have a series of article excerpts posted blog-style, each enclosed in a div class="article" tag.  How would I go about having the system also post a class="first" to the first article in the series and a class="last" in the last article?

I'd also like to apply the same to the first and last li tags in the navigation.

I know I can use :first-child and :last-child in my CSS, but I'm hoping there's a way to add the classes instead.

Thanks,

Chris
