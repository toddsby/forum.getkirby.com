Text: I'm a very beginner. I just uploaded all files in kirbycms-master folder via FTP. The links from About, Project and Contact is not working. I saw Kirby Troubleshooting and seems I have to set up rewrite rules on my server? Please let me know how to do that. I'm using BlueHost. Should I add some code in .htaccess? 

URL-Rewriting
Can't detect url rewriting. You are probably not running Kirby on Apache. You might need to setup your own rewrite rules depending on your server setup.
