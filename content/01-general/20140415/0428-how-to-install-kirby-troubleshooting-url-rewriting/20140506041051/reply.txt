Text: I had the identical problem at initial set up. None of the 3 default linked pages on default homepage worked.

To fix this, I added this text below to my .htaccess file, which I copied from the top answer on this (link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/869092/how-to-enable-mod-rewrite-for-apache-2-2 popup: yes text:Stack Overflow post). Prior to adding this, my .htaccess file was a completely blank/empty file. 

``<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>``
``    RewriteEngine On``
``   RewriteBase /``
``   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f``
``    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d``
``    RewriteRule . /index.php [L]``
``</IfModule>``

After adding this text to the .htaccess file, all the links worked from the default homepage on my Kirby test install, and subsequent pages created / links work now as well.

If above modification of .htaccess file is not recommended for Kirby install (where Kirby is running entire site, not just in a subfolder), maybe someone on this forum here can alert this. I'd rather not spread mis-information!
