Text: Sorry guys, I have minimal PHP experience, here is my issue:
I've got custom fields set up in my blog blueprint that looks something like this:

    category:
      label: Category
      type: text

It works great. I'm able to input a value such as "Travel", and it displays when I do:

    <?php echo $article->category() ?>

Problem is, I want to display a custom image based on each of my categories.  So I tried doing something like this... 

    <?php if ($article->category() !='travel'): ?>
    (travel image)
    <?php else: ?>
    (default image)
    <? endif ?>

But that doesn't seem to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
