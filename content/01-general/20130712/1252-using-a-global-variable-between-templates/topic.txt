Text: Hi everyone,

i'm currently working on a side project where i want to create a simple product portfolio.

Basically I have 8 main categories and everytime a user clicks on one category he/she is directed to the subfolder "showProducts". 

The template "showProduct" then should read the current selected category from a global variable and requests all data related to this category from db.

As a simple step I would create a subfolder for each category etc. but it would create a big overhead for me. So I decided to create one subfolder showProduct which gets the current selected category and requests the data from a db.

I've tried the "c::set" and "c::get" functions, but that doesn't create a global variable which i can change dynamically. 

Is it possible to have some kind of a global variable?
Or maybe I can commit a value to the template file ?

Kd and thx for replies :)
