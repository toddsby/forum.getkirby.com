Text: I'm wondering if I would set it up sort of like a blog with each post being a person, and set up tags for the letters?

i.e. in the content:
Tag: s (for smith)
Name: Adam Smith

Then do a function to output the list of A-Z tags on the archives page. 

Does that make sense? Anything that would point me in the right direction would be great. 

I'm happy to pay someone to assist me.
