Text: Wondering if someone could please assist?  

I want to implement a section of a site for a "people" page as per this example:
http://www.bdplaw.com/our-people

It has a search bar, and letters to narrow your search. If you click on a letter it takes you to search results for that letter, and then you can click on a person's name for their bio. 

How would I go about setting this up with Kirby? 

Thanks in advance!
