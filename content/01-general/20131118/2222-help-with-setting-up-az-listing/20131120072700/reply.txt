Text: Thanks! I've taken a look and think I might be able to work it out. 

Good idea splitting the first and last name. 

Do you think it'd be possible to output tags which don't have results? I'd like to output all letters A through Z even if they haven't got a person that begins with that letter. And have them styled so it's obvious they don't lead anywhere. 

Does that make sense?

Also, would it be possible to search for only the first character of the name, so it assigns the tag to it? Or would I have to add a tags category for this and then search for tags to output. 

Thanks!
