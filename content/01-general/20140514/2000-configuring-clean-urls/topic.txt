Text: Hey,

I have tried all the tricks in the book (enabling RewriteEngine, changing RewriteBase in .htaccess and setting rewrite to true in the config) but I am yet to get clean URLs working in Kirby.

Here's the site: http://jackg.co.uk which is still using the default template.

What other things can I do? I am running a virtual server on DigitalOcean. This is the first time I have had issues with Kirby.

Best,
Jack
