Text: What about:

Creating a new blog post - and copy the whole text from the last blogpost inside but with the "updatet" text.
At the end link to the old blogpost.
Also add a link to the old blogpost, that there exists an updated post.

I donÂ´t think there is another solution when sorting it by date.

**Edit:**
Maybe there is one:
Create two date fields inside a blogpost:
- date
- update
On creation both are the same. But when you update something you change the 'update' date.

Now all there is left to do: Sort everything by the 'update' date and not the normal 'date'.
