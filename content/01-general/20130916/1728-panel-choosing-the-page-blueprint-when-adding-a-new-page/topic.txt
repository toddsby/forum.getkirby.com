Text: Hi guys,

I was just wondering how I could select a custom blueprint I created when adding a new page.

When I take a look at the ["findTemplates" function](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/blob/cd73a7a15102db367c9d9747d8a8154eaf538d93/lib/data.php), it seems it looks for templates.

Can I just activate the right blueprint only in the folder/file structure or is there a way to do it in the panel ?

Best regards,

B.
