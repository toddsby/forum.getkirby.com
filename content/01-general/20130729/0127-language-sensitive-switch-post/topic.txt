Text: I have a multi-language site with a blog that filters articles by language, i.e. the German blog lists German articles and the English one translated articles only.

I also managed to get the pagination problem fixed, as explained here:(link: http://www.texniq.de/en/texniq-u/kirby-multilingual-site).

However, I cannot get the switch post navigation to ignore the German articles on the English blog, the $page->hasPrev method will find and link to the default language articles...

Any ideas?
