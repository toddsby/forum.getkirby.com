Text: Hi, 

I am sure I am missing something very simple but when I try to pass a variable in <code>$page->files()->find()</code>, I get the errors: 

<code>Warning: Illegal offset type in isset or empty in /Site/www/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 156
Fatal error: Call to a member function url() on a non-object in /Site/www/site/templates/design.php on line 16</code>

My code is like this: 

<code>$thumb = $article->thumb();
echo $article->files()->find($thumb)->url();</code>

Thanks for the help.
