Text: Sorry, I was being a bit dense (too hot) so you want to use a text field as a variable for use in a find and get the path.

Assuming you want the local uri...and a text file which includes...
```html
Fieldtxt: findme.jpg
```
try something like

```php
<?php
$var= $page->files()
           ->find($page->fieldtxt
                       ->value)
           ->uri();
?>
```

$var will be `content/folder/findme.jpg`

Hope I have got it right this time?
