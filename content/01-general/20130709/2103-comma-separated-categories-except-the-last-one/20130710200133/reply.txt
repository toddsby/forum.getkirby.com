Text: I did something similar to what you suggested, but it didn't work. Your suggestion gave me this error:


Notice: Undefined variable: str in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/blog/site/templates/blog.php on line 40

Fatal error: Class name must be a valid object or a string in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/blog/site/templates/blog.php on line 40

Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.
