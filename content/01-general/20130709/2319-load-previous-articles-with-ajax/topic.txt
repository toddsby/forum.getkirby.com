Text: Hi guys,

Is there someone who already did it in one of his website with kirby :

Load next articles or pages in the same page with Ajax ? 
The visitor click on "Load previous articles" and XX articles appear under the initial articles list without getting in a new page... 

If you don't see what I mean, you can see this feature in Wordpress on this blog : www.lokan.fr .

Hope someone can help me, 
Thanks in advance

Regards,

Julien
