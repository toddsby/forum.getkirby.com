Text: Hey guys,

Today I was feeling a bit spontaneous and started the move from WordPress to Kirby after getting slowly less and less satisfied with how bloated WP was becoming.

The WordPress migration script didn't work for me (from what I can tell, it was choking on some malformed content and/or the size of my site) but I quickly hacked up a script to process the XML export dump from WordPress and convert it into a bunch of directories and files for Kirby. [My blog](http://andywarburton.co.uk) is now quite happily running on Kirby but I have a bunch of broken links that I would like to fix. (for example the url /2009/07/tickets-booked/ is now /tickets-booked/ under Kirby).

My server is running Nginx and I would like to somehow redirect all of the old URL's to the new ones so that I don't end up with a lot of 404 errors (otherwise I'll have to go through all the posts and find the broken links and fix them manually which will be a nightmare given that I have ten years of posts and hundreds of internal links!)

If anyone can help me fix this, I'll be really happy and ready to dig in and buy my first Kirby license!

Thanks

Andy
