Text: OK, I'm not even entirely sure what this is doing anymore, and I think I borrowed some of the code from another thread here somewhere. But this code is successfully displaying a list of linked tags on my blog articles.

    <?php
        $count = 0;
        foreach ($tags = explode(",", $page->tags()) as $tag) {
            $count++;
            echo '<a href="'.url().'blog/tag:'.urlencode(trim($tag)).'">'.str_replace('-',' ', $tag).'</a>';
            if ($count != count($tags)) {echo ',';}
        }
    ?>
