Text: I’ve been reading through the tutorial about creating a [tag cloud](http://getkirby.com/blog/tagcloud), but can’t figure out how to apply this information to output a linked tagged list at the foot of each post/article. I can output the list from the YAML header, as in:

    Tags: Widgets, Apples, Bananas

but I can’t figure out how to turn individual tags into links that take you to a URL listing all articles for a given tag, e.g.:

    http://domain.com/widgets

If the tag cloud works, I’m sure there must be a way to do this.
