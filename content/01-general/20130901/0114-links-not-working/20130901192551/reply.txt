I found my solution here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/48362/how-to-enable-mod-rewrite-in-apache
<code>  
    <Directory /var/www/>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            # changed from None to FileInfo
            AllowOverride FileInfo
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
    </Directory>
</code>
