Text: Thank you. I actually found the solution earlier but forgot to get back in here to mark it as solved. 

As for excluding the thumbnail in the individual view, I ended up using this instead: 

`<?php foreach($page->images()->not('thumb.png') as $image): ?>`

Works the same to me, but looks a bit cleaner.

Thanks.
