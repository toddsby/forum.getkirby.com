Text: When I set file extension in config.php to md

c::set('content.file.extension', 'md');

my whole site went blank, when I changed the extension.

Do I need to change every file with a txt extension to md (e.g., blog.txt, site.txt. page.txt)? Or just files article.text.txt? (If the latter, why did my whole site disappear?)
