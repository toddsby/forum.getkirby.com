Text: Ok. AUTH works as expected, but as soon as i copy my kirby.extended.php file 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/qu7d1d1vreg348q/kirby.extended.php

back into the plugins folder its broken again:

Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /www/htdocs/w00586db/tonevariations/site/plugins/kirby.extended.php:2) in /www/htdocs/w00586db/tonevariations/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 47


removing the lines 47 and 48 in kirby.php mentioned above:
  header('Location:' . $url);
  exit();

results in the site working again, but no login appears.

grrrr.... 

:)
