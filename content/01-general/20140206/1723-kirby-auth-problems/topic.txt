Text: Hi,
I am pretty sure i followed the exact steps here, 
https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/auth

and added the line 

<?php Auth::firewall() ?>

To my default.php as outlined in the link above.


As soon as i do that, i get the following error:


Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /www/htdocs/w00586db/tonevariations/site/plugins/kirby.extended.php:2) in /www/htdocs/w00586db/tonevariations/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 47




Any ideas whats happening?
I am no expert on this at all...

Thanks a lot!
