Text: Hi,
Thanks for your efforts in helping me out here. :)

my server is running PHP 5.4.

there is no plugin, just the modified kirby.extended.php, the one you used.

its supposed to work with a playlist, here is an example  that should produce an actual playlist (it is working on my end without AUTH) :

project.txt:

<pre><code>
   Title: Music
   ----
   Text: 
   (soundcloud:https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?  url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/13921885&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true)


</code></pre>

and the corresponding php template 
project.php
