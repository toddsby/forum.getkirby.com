Well, removing the AUTH folder gives the following error.

Fatal error: Class 'Auth' not found in /www/htdocs/w00586db/tonevariations/site/templates/default.php on line 1


That makes sense, since i added the php "firewall" one-liner to my default php (as suggested in the auth setup instructions) which would not work without the auth folder obviously.

If i remove that line from default.php everything works fine.

I may try to configure everything from scratch again. But i think i did that twice already. 
hmm...
