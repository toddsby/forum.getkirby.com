Text: Using either Markdown or html, my blockquotes don't render. They show in page source as blockquotes, but no indentation, no italics. CSS is (unchanged) as below. 

article blockquote {
    margin: 10px 20px 20px 20px;
    padding: 0 15px;
    float: left;
    font-style: italic;
    border-left: 10px solid #e5e5e5;
}
