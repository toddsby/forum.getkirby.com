Text: Okay, I figured it out.

With the tagcloud, you can't have sortBy, but you can open up an array on the tagcloud and add a few declarations like so:

    $tags = tagcloud($work, array('sort' => 'name','sortdir' => 'desc'));

    <?php foreach($tags as $tag): ?>
      <li><a <?php if($tag->isActive()) echo ' class="active"' ?> href="<?php echo $tag->url() ?>"><?php echo $tag->name() ?></a></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>

Thanks,
