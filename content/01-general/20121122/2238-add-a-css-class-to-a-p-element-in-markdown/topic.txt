Text: Hi, couldnt find anything about this topic in the docs - maybe anyone here can help. 

I want to add a custom class eg. p.intro to the markdown text. 
i tried (had to strip out brackets)
    p class="intro" 
        echo kirbytext($page->text())
    /p

but it doesnt have an effect. 

p.intro is in the output but directly closed and another p tag below. 

Hope someone has an idea.
