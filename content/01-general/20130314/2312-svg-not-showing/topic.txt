Text: Hello I cannot for the life of me figure out why I cannot get my logo to display at the top of my page.  I have tried multiple directory paths but still nothing.

The image is located in /kirby/assets/images/jte.svg

Here is what I have been trying.

      <img class="logo1" src="/assets/images/jte.svg" alt="Logo">

Any ideas?
