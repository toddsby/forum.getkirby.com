Text: Hi all

I want to be able to write my own markup in posts as a I go so I am using the markdown variable: markdown($text) to render posts.

I'm finding that when I add the html for links, it's adding onto the end of my URL.

For example: http://www.iwearglasses.net/blog/%E2%80%9Chttp://www.twitter.com/

Has anyone encountered this before or knows how to prevent?

Cheers
Paul
