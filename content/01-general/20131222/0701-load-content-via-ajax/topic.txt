Text: Hello Everyone,

First, I've done my Forum/Google search and couldn't find anything to help get me started so I'm coming here for help.

I've created a blog and I would like to use Ajax to load the contents of the blog post within the main archive page instead of having the blog post go to a new page.

Basically, I want to click on the link/excerpt and have that expand and have the full content of the post load.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Gary
