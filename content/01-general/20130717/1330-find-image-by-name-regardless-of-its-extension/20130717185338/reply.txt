Text: I also have an evolving snippet that will take a passed image title and look for an SVG version (because scalable vector is preferred). If it doesn't find it, it will look for a PNG version instead. It applies a class of "svg" to SVG images, that is used by my script for IE8 that replaces the SVG with the PNG alternative.

It also takes any alt info from the descriptive text file that goes with the image, and you can pass additional classes with the embed.

I'm not sure I'm willing to share this yet, but you can have all kinds of fun with it. :-)

Note: Currently, Kirby doesn't return SVGs as images. You have to use the `files()` function instead.
