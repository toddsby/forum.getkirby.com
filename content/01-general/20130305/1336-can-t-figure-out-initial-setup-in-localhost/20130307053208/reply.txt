Text: Since two or more versions, Kirby is more powerful in those cases. You simply have to change the rewrite base in the .htaccess to /kirby

Set *url* and *subfolder* settings to default :

	c::set('url', false);
	c::set('subfolder', 'false');

You'll probably doesn't need to change the aboves. 

It's what I use and it works fine.
