Text: Hi, I have a similar problem and I'm running a LAMP-server on Ubuntu. I copied the over the files to home/user/public_html/mysite.
When I navigate to localhost, I get the error "The Kirby system could not be loaded". 
I tried to set the values 'url' and 'subfolder' in config.php with your suggestions but I always get that error.
Please help me.
