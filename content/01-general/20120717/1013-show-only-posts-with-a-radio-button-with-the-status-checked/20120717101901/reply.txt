Text: Just add that to the chain you are using in the foreach loop: 

```php
<?php foreach($portfolio->children()->visible()->filterBy('radio', 'radioyes')->flip()->limit(3) as $img): ?>
```

That translates to: 

1. take all subfolders of the portfolio folder
2. only take the visible subfolders
3. filter the visible subfolders by the radio field with the value radioyes
4. flip the sort order 
5. only use the first three of them
