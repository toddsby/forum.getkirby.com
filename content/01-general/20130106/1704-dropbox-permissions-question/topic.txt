Hey guys, 

I followed the steps in these tutorials to get a Dropbox-powered site running on Uberspace:

http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-meets-dropbox

However I'm a bit uncertain as to the correct way to set permissions etc. so would appreciate feedback from anyone else with a similar setup. 

I first created a regular Dropbox folder that I symlinked into my regular ~/html/content directory. This worked fine for everything except direct downloads etc, as Apache can't access files directly in my home folder.

So I've changed the configuration that the whole content folder is now on Dropbox and symlinked into /var/www/myuser/html/content like this:

    $ ln -s /var/www/mykirbysite.com/content ~/Dropbox/mykirbysite

This works perfectly (including downloads), however when I create a new folder on Dropbox, it is created with 777 permissions in /www, making it fully writable for anyone - dangerous!

So what is the correct way to set up Dropbox and Uberspace for Kirby? 

Thanks!
Adrian
