Text: I am trying to add a drop-down menu to my main navigation menu.

1. How do i structure the drop-down sub menu in my content folder?
Should it be something like 

	01-about/
	 01-about.txt
	  /contact/
	   contact.txt

2. in the default.php how does Kirby distinguish between submenu and nested menu?

	`<?php snippet('header') ?>`
        `<?php snippet('menu') ?>`
	`<?php snippet('submenu') ?>`
	`<?php snippet('nestedmenu') ?>`

Should I delete the submenu line?

I also added nestedmenu.php into my snippets folder and the end result is that I get two copies of navigation menus one under the other.
