Text: Hi, I am trying to get a specific page by $uid. It work on my main language, but won’t show the english page (I setted URL-Key: projects).
It does work if I remove the URL-Key. Here’s my code.

    <?php $children = $pages->find('projets')->children() ?>

I also tried to set up the same custom key value on both description.

    <?php $children = $pages->findBy('lieninterne', 'projets')->children() ?>

It work with my main language, but not on the english one. Instead, I get this error.
