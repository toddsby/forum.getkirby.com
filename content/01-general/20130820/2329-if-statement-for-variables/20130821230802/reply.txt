Text: The `->visible()` statement you already have is what gets visible children.

Your `if($prints)` or `if(!empty($prints))` would only check if the entire group of pages is empty or not.

Why do you need that? I'd remove the if statement altogether. You're already checking for visible pages. Unless I misunderstand what you're trying to do.
