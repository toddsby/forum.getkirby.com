Text: Sorry, misunderstood, what you were asking for. I don't think it works like that, you can pass params, but not like that. 

You can of course test for and get params and then perhaps pump them into a snippet as a variable? You can maybe have multiple params with some special handling -- Bastian maybe able to advise here?

```php 
 if(param('something')) {
  ...
 }
```

My original replay for question was for calling snippets with params not from from URL params. I left it here because it may be helpful.

```php
snippet('mySnippet',
array('something' => 'funky','somethingelse' => 'notsofunky')
)
```
