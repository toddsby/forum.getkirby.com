Text: You can with, after a fashion, with [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/). 

in your config.php

```php
c::set('markdown.extra', true);
```

If you need special stuff and are using the panel then why not set up a template with your options and make the changes in CSS?
