Text: After my (link: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:367 text: last issue) with generating a lot of thumbs I wondered if it's possible to reduce server usage with php extensions like (link: http://xcache.lighttpd.net text: XCache) or (link: http://eaccelerator.net text: eAccelerator). Someone has taken the benefit and it's works well with Kirby?
