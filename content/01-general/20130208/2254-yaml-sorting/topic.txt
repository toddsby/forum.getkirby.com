Text: Hi,

I'm having a lot of trouble trying to sort a simple array.  I know it should be easy but i can't seem to get it working.

    ----
	Heading1: Company Name:
	----
	Heading2: Booth Number:
	----

	Exhibitors:

	  List1:

	    - Booth: 100
	      Company: Teacher

	    - Booth: 200
	      Company: Aba

	    - Booth: 300
	      Company: Zabanty 

	    - Booth: 400
	      Company: Beacher

	    - Booth: 500
	      Company: Cba 

	    - Booth: 600
	      Company: Xabanty 

Which makes my array look like:
    Array
    (
        [List1] => Array
            (
                [0] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 100
                        [Company] => Teacher
                    )

                [1] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 200
                        [Company] => Aba
                    )

                [2] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 300
                        [Company] => Zabanty
                    )

                [3] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 400
                        [Company] => Beacher
                    )

                [4] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 500
                        [Company] => Cba
                    )

                [5] => Array
                    (
                        [Booth] => 600
                        [Company] => Xabanty
                    )

            )

    )

And my .php template has the following in it:

    <?php $array = yaml($page->exhibitors()) ?>
	<table id="sched">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col"><?php echo $page->heading1() ?></th>
				<th scope="col"><?php echo $page->heading2() ?></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<?php $lister = $array['List1'] ?>
			<?php foreach($lister as $list): ?>
			<tr>
				<td><?php echo $list['Company'] ?></td>
				<td><?php echo $list['Booth'] ?></td>
			</tr>
			<?php endforeach ?>
		</tbody>
	</table>

The above php gives me the list displayed in the ordered i entered it without problem, but i'm trying to get it alphabetically and not sure how to go about doing it.

I've tried variations of this based off the array documentation but php is still very new to me (just gives me errors):
	
	<?php $list = $array['List1'] ?>
	<?php $company = 'Company' ?>
	<?php a::sort($list, $company, $direction='desc', $method=SORT_REGULAR) ?>
	<?php echo a::show($list) ?>
