Text: Questions:

1. Do you think Kirby's search feature can handle if there are thousands of pages? If there some kind of cache mechanism similar to database indexing?

2. Or should I use the Kirby Toolkit to store data in MySQL instead?

3. Or should I use 3rd party solution like Google Custom Search Engine (https://www.google.com/cse/)

4. Is there a way to sort search result order by Title, Tag, or Date?



Thank you.
