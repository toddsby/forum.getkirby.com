Text: I have two Custom Post Types.
  - Lettering
  - Type

Each Custom Post Type will have invisible subpages that I'll name after clients.
e.g.
  - Google (Lettering)
  - Yahoo (Type)
  - Facebook (Type)

This is to have my URL's appear organized like so:   
  - *mysite.com/lettering/google*
  - *mysite.com/type/yahoo*

My question is how do I display my Custom Fields in the Panel *only* to those subpages and not on the main Custom Post Type (Lettering, Type)? Also, how/where do I echo out the fields?

    <?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>

    title: Meta
    pages: 
      template:
        - type
        - lettering
    files: true
    fields:
      description:
        label: Description
        type: textarea
        size: medium
        buttons: 
          - h1
          - h2
          - h3
          - bold
          - italic
          - email
          - link
      client:
        label: Client
        type: text
      art_direction:
        label: Art Direction
        type: text
      typeface:
        label: Typeface
        type: text
