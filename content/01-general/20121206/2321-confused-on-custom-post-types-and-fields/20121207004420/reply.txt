I like to think of Kirby as levels, not posts.

You make a panel blueprint for each level by naming the file the same as the content file for that level.

So for Lettering, if you have a content folder with a file named lettering.txt with subpages in that being your individual lettering projects, you'll make a blueprint called lettering.php and probably one called projects.php which control each project.

So you content structure should look something like this:

    - 01-home
      - home.txt  >  **blueprint is home.php**
    - 02-lettering
      - 01-lettering-project-1
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - 02-lettering-project-2
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - 03-lettering-project-3
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - lettering.txt  >  **blueprint is lettering.php**
    - 03-type
      - 01-lettering-project-1
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - 02-lettering-project-2
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - 03-lettering-project-3
        - project.txt  >  **blueprint is project.php**
      - type.txt  >  **blueprint is type.php**
    - 04-about
      - about.txt  >  **blueprint is about.php**


You can use these fields in your page templates like this:

    <?php echo $page->title() ?>
    
    <?php echo $page->typeface() ?>
    
    <?php echo $page->art_direction() ?>
