Text: Ah, to get those URL's, you'll have to do the two page types, then...

Here's the content structure I would do:

    - 01-home
      - home.txt
    - 02-about
      - about.txt
    - 03-portfolio
      - lettering (no number, to make it invisible)
        - 01-lettering-project-name
          - project.txt
        - 02-lettering-project-name
          - project.txt
        - lettering.txt
      - type (no number, to make it invisible)
        - 01-type-project-name
          - project.txt
        - 02-type-project-name
          - project.txt
        - type.txt
    - 04-articles
      - articles.txt


You'll then use a php loop in your Portfolio template to pull in your lettering and type projects.
