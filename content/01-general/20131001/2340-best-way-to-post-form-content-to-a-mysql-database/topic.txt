Text: Hi guys,

one question.
What is the best way inside Kirby to post content of a form to a MYSQL database?

I tried it with 
`<form role="form" action="save.php" method="post">`
but unfortunately Kirby doesn't find my save.php file and I am running out of ideas where to put it.

Would be nice if anyone could help me out on this.

Thanks
