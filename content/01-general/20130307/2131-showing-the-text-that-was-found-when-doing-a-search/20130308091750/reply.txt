Text: The array return contains quite a lot so you can use most of it, I'd check to see if it exists before doing anything with it though (I've not done that here for clarity:)

Assuming $item is your array and your have a text field, something like

```php
<?php echo $item->text() ?>
```
Or if you have a description field, something like

```php
<?php echo $item->description() ?>
```
*You may end up with some problems doing this if the string you return contains a list for example and you truncate midway through the list*. One way to fix some of this is to remove html and get an excerpt using the toolkit, maybe [*str::excerpt*](http://toolkit.getkirby.com/docs/classes/str/excerpt)
