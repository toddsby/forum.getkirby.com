Text: I cannot quite see what you want here? If you want two galleries then two folders would be good?
```html
Photography
        photography.txt
    01-project-a
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        gallery.txt
    02-project-b
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        gallery.txt
```
You can use the same code for both? 'photography.txt' and 'photography.php' for gallery index and then gallery.txt/gallery.php for gallery display?

Sorry if this is not what you want?
