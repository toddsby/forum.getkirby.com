Text: I want to use `url()` in my templates to save having to make edits once I push them to my server. Here is an example of how Iâ€™m using it:

    <a href="<?php url('about') ?>">about</a>

which should link to `example.dev/about`. Clicking the link does nothing. 

My config file has the following setting:

    c::set('url', 'http://example.dev');

and htaccess has:

    RewriteBase /

Any advice appreciated.
