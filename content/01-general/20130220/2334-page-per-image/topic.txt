I've created a gallery using the excellent thumbnail plugin. Each item links to the original large version of the image.

Rather than using a lightbox plugin to display the large image, I'd like to have a page where I can display the image.

Is it possible to create a template that displays one image? And if so, how would I link to it _without_ having to create a .txt file for each image?

Hope this makes sense!

Thanks.
