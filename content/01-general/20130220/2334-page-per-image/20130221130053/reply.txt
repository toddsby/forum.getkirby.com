Text: I think Dribble are doing a sort of 'in-situ lightboxy' Javascript effect, because if you turn off JS it doesn't work?

+ I seem to remember there are quite a few javascripts for that, although I cannot actually think of any at present.

+ One simple way of doing might be to make the image open in a new page with 
```html 
target="_blank"
``` 
You can also do something similar with KirbyText I believe;-)

+ Another option would be to send the image link to another bit of PHP code which displayed the images.
