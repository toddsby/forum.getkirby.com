Text: So in Kirby is there a way I can take each thumbnail link and do something like this:

``<a href="/gallery/album-name/01"/>``

And have build a template for ``XX.php`` ? Does that make sense? So on that page I'd have something like this:

```
<? $filename=somehow get the filename from the url
foreach($page->parent()->files()->find($filename) as $image): ?>

display the image.

<?endforeach;?>```

Thanks!
