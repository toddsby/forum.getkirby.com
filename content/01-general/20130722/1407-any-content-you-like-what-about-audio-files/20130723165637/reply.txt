Text: OR... I could simply add a HTML5 audio with

	<audio controls>
	  <source src="$myfile" type="audio/mpeg">
	  Your browser does not support this audio format.
	</audio> 

But... I if understand correctly, I would have to extend the Kirbytext class myself to get a new tag for it ?

PS: no playlist possible with it
