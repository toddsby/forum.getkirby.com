Text: Hey all, 

I'm trying to get a count of the number of images in a project. I haven't found a reference to an imageCount function, but I did find the value I'm looking for by doing a var_dump of $page->images :

	array(2) {
	  ["pagination"]=&gt;
	  NULL
	  ["_"]=&gt;
	  array(8) {
	    ["01.jpg"]=&gt;
	    object(image)#379 (2) {
	      ["meta"]=&gt;

What I need is line 5, the length of that array. How can I echo it?

Thanks.
