Text: There was a problem! After I added a feed, my process of calling the latest post only called the feed. So I combined my little bit of code with the little bit above and got this

    <?php $latest = $pages->find('blog') ?>
      
    <?php foreach($latest->children()->visible()->flip()->limit(1) as $article): ?>

    <article>
      <h1><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></h1>
      <?php echo kirbytext($article->text()) ?>
    </article>

    <?php endforeach ?> 

And it seems to work well.
