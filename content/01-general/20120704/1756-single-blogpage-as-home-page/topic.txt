Text: Hi everybody!
I'm looking for a nice way to set my last blogarticle as the "home-page" so I can navigate with _"next"_ and _"prev"_ to the next articles. 
I tried it with an extra template for "home" but then my "nextprev" navigation was not working anymore... 

Anyone a good idea how to do that?

Thanks, Oli
