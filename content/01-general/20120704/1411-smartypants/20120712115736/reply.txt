Text: Good news â€“ SmartyPants is now included in the latest dev version: <http://cl.ly/I33u> :D

If you update your Kirby version, you can activate it in your config like this: 

```php
c::set('smartypants', true);
```

Please check out the latest version of the `config.php` for more smartypants options:

I hope you like it!!
