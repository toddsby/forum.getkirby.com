Text: Is it possible to add [Smartypants and Smartypants Typographer](http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/) to the parsers as an (optional) addition to the Markdown and/or Markdown Extra parsers?

Or is there an easy way I can do it myself?

That would be great, good typography is a must!
