Text: Hi,

I couldn't find any complete example how to display a list of documents uploaded to one page. Like this it doesn't work:

    <?php if($page->hasDocuments()): ?> 		
      <ul>
      <?php foreach($page->documents() as $document): ?> 		
         <li><a href="<?php echo $document->url() ?>"><?php echo $document->filename() ?></a></li>		
    <?php endforeach ?>		
    </ul>		
    <?php endif ?>

Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks in advance. :)
