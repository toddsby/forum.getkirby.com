Text: Hi Everybody!

I have some pages with persons. Every person hase a checkboxfield with some features i can check. For example:
	
	Titel: Jason
	----
	sport: soccer, tennis
	----

Now I have other pages with sports. On this pages I have a snippet taht filters  my persons for their sports like this (That's working very well):
	
	 <?php $sport = $pages->findbyUID('persons') ?>
	 <?php foreach($sport->children()->visible()->filterBy('sport', 'soccer', ',') as $img): ?>
	 
Now I'm looking for a way to use my actual page title as a 'value' for filtering. because I don't want to have hundreds of snippets for every sport. Unfortunately this is not working: 

	<?php $sport = $pages->findbyUID('persons') ?>
	<?php $sitetitle = $page->title() ?>
	<?php foreach($sport->children()->visible()->filterBy('sport', '$sitetitle', ',') as $img): ?>
	
	
 Anyone an idea how I can solve this?
