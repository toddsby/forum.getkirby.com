Text: Hey there,
just a quick question.

I want to show a "Next" and "Prev" Link on a Page - if the page has siblings.

I looked into ->paginate() but I can not use as I am working already on a subpage.
Here is what I have so far - which is not working. 



    <?php 
    $uid = $page->uid();
    $siblings = $page->siblings()->visible()->findByUID("$uid");
    ?>
    <nav class="sibling-nav">
        <a href="<?=$siblings->next()->url()?>" rel="prev">Prev</a>
        <a href="<?=$siblings->prev()->url()?>" rel="prev">Next</a>
    </nav>

Any ideas?
