Text: No, to make it a bit more clear , here is my structure:

    parent
      child1
      child2
      child3

Now child2 is open: I want to show a next link to child3 and a prev link to child1.

If child 3 is open: Only show a prev link to child3
If child 1 is open: Only show a next link to child1

I know I get the current page via `$page` and its siblings via `$page->siblings()`

But how do I get the position of the page itself inside the siblings to get exactly the next/previous sibling?
