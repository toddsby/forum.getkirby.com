Text: @bastianallgeier Exactly what I did:
```
[…]
-01-category
---category.txt
-02-category
---category.txt
[…]
```
But I'm stuck at this code `template/category.php`:
In fact wen I change `->find('category-1')` it's displays obviously only that category for all. What variable I should use to dynamically display any category with his child articles?
```php
<?php $articles = $pages->find('???')
                        ->children()
                        ->visible()
                        ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
                        ->paginate(5); ?>
```
