Text: @roman_oroco it seems i deleted my previous post when editing the reply.. anyway, instead of `$pages` use `$page`

Since you are accessing the actual category page already (based on your folder structure above), all you have to do is show its children.

	<?php $articles = $page->children()
	                       ->visible()
	                       ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
	                       ->paginate(5); ?>
