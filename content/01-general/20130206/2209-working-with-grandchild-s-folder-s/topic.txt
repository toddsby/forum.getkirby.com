Text: The idea of this content structure is to have more nicer url for articles:
```
content
-01-articles
--01-category-1
---01-article-1
---02-article-2
--02-category-2
---01-article-3
---01-article-4
```
Similiar approach is used by Kirby's form:

I can't figure out how do display each child articles of current category:

```php
<?php $articles = $pages->find('???')
                        ->children()
                        ->visible()
                        ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
                        ->paginate(5); ?>
```
1. `site.com/articles/category-1/` — should display all articles in that specific folder.

2. `site.com/articles/category-x/` — same for all eventually created subfolders.
