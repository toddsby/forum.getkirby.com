Text: The case:

I use params to filter some products like this way :

/products/product-1/grid:list/cat:600-1000
/products/product-1/grid:list/cat:1000-2000

I want to use a toggle to switch between two grids (list and thumbnails).

I'm looking for the simple way to.. simply.. remove the "/grid:list" part from my url to display the thumbnails grid.

I'm using $parent->url() to redirect users wich is not the best.. I want something clean and if the 'cat' param is set, I want to keep it.
