Text: Hi there.

Just a short question about the "$pages->find()" function
.

How can I use the value of a field from a page .txt-file inside "$pages->find()" function? Example:

In my home.txt a have this populated field:

    product: product1

Inside my template:

    <?php $productpage = $pages->find($page->product()) ?>
    <?php echo $productpage->url() ?>

Returns:

Fatal error: Call to a member function url() on a non-object in â€¦

Basically, I want to find a page based on the value of a field in my home.txt file. Is there another way of finding a page based on the value of a field in your page .txt-file?

Thanks in advance :)
