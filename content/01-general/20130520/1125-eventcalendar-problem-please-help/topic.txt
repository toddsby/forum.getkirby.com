Text: Hello!

I'm trying to put a calendar in my website, I have downloaded a event Calendar , but I don't know what to do to make it appear in my website. 
I have made a snippet called calendar, and then, I have moved his css, js and json to the folder assest. When I called the snippet for appearing in my website only appear the title. I think that this problem is because of the json file, but I don't know how I might make it.

Please, if you know how I can put the calendar in my website, tell me, I thank you a lot!

Thanks!
