Text: I've used some code from the Baseblog theme to set up Categories on my blog articles, and it's working great. I'm using this code for each article:

```php
<ul>
<li>Posted in:</li>
<?php foreach(str::split($article->categories()) as $category): ?>
<li><a href="<?php echo url('blog/category:' . urlencode($category)) ?>"><?php echo $category; ?></a></li>
<?php endforeach ?>
</ul>		
```

I want to have an All Categories list in my sidebar. I've got this working as well, but I don't know how to remove the duplicates:

```php
<ul>
<?php $inblog = $pages->find('blog') ?>
<?php foreach($inblog->children()->visible() as $blogarts): ?>
<?php foreach(str::split($blogarts->categories()) as $category): ?>
<li><a href="<?php echo url('category:' . urlencode($category)) ?>"><?php echo $category; ?></a></li>
<?php endforeach ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```

I know my PHP could be written better, but it's working. I can clean it up eventually. I'd just like to remove the duplicates.
