Text: PHP needs to be compiled with mbstring functions <http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php> 

I always thought that this is a standard, but it seems that more and more users run into similar problems. I use those functions to ensure that Kirby is working with UTF-8, but I will add fallbacks if those functions are not available in the next version.
