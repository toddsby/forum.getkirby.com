Text: Hey guys, 

I'm sorry that it took so long, but I finally fixed the problem â€“ I hope :) Get the latest dev version: <http://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/tree/dev> to get rid of that nasty bug in site.php

Now you can use the toggle as it is in the gist. 

To find the right url of a page for any available language you can do: 

```

<?php echo $pages->find('about-us')->url('de') ?>

<?php echo $pages->find('about-us')->url('en') ?>

```

Just use the folder name without number for the find method. It will automatically figure out, which the translated url should be if a url key is available. 

I hope this helps. 

Cheers
