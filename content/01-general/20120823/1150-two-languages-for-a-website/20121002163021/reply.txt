Text: What, if I don't need the url, but the the title?

<?php echo $pages->find('about-us')->title('en') ?>

doesn't work.

Maybe it would be better, to make somethink like this:

<?php echo $pages->find('about-us', 'en')->url() ?>
<?php echo $pages->find('about-us', 'en')->title() ?>

What are you're suggestions?
