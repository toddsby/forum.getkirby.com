Text: I'm working on an application cache manifest file and have a question regarding the .htaccess file and blocking access to certain directories and files. I understand blocking access to your standard user, but how can I still access for the appcache so I can cache these files for offline viewing? Currently when I try to cache I get errors like this:

	Application Cache Error event: Resource fetch failed (-1) https://amemoirproject.com/site/config/config.php
