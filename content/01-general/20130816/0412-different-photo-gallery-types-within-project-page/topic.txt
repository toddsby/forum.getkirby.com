Text: I'm building out a portfolio site for someone at the moment, and I'm kind of stumped on an issue. On each project page, I have it set so that there are "sub-projects" within a project. So, the project page is for a client, and then there can be multiple projects within that client, for example, 'identity', 'business card', etc. All of these "sub-projects" show at once on the page. 

I have that all working fine, and it pulls in the photos and sub-project info fine. Each sub-project is in it's own folder within the parent project/client folder. My folder structure is like this, for reference: 
* 01-client
** 01-identity
** 02-business-card


My issue is that some of these sub-projects need to have image sliders in them, while others are just images listed out. 

Is there any way I can accomplish this, or is it not even doable? Is there some way I can tag a sub-project with "hasSlides" or something, so that I can do an if statement to select which code to run? 

Thanks in advance for any help! I appreciate it.
