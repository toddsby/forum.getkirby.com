Text: It's possible but would need a bit of extra work. 

What I would do in general for an events calendar is to add a subfolder for each event like articles in a blog. For repeating events I would add another dedicated "repeating" subfolder, with subfolders for each repeating event. So something like

```

- events
-- repeating
--- my-first-repeating-event
--- my-second-repeating-event
-- my-first-regular-event
-- my-second-regular-event 

```

You'd need a bit of PHP trickery to merge them and show them in a calendar or blog view, but it wouldn't be too hard. 

I won't find the time to help you out with code for this in the next days, but if you don't mind waiting for it a bit, I'd be happy to help you out.
