Text: I'm using the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/email text: Email Plugin) to turn some forms into mails using (link: https://postmarkapp.com text: Postmark). My problem is that every query seems to be done twice as I'm receiving every mail twice.

I've just added these two lines in my config.php:

```php
c::set('email.use', 'postmark');
c::set('email.postmark.key', 'my key');
```

And my template I'm testing with looks like this:

```php
<?php 
	$send = email(array(
		'to'      => 'Marcel BÃ¶ttcher <boettcher@uiux.de>',
		'from'    => 'Post Office <postoffice@uiux.de>',
		'subject' => 'Subject',
		'body'    => 'Some lines...'
	));
?>
```

Does anybody have an idea what's going wrong here or how to debug this?
