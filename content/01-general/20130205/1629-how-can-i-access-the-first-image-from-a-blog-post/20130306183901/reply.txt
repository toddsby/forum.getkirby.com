Text: I did check if there are any images, but the error still occured. It's been a while since this post, but I found a workaround using the thumb plugin.

    <? foreach($page->children()->visible() as $product):
    if ($product->hasImages()):
    $image = thumb($product->images()->first(), array('width' => 300), false);?>
    <img src="<? echo $image ?>" />
    <? 
    endif; 
    endforeach;
    ?>

Hope this helps anyone.
