Text: I have two online courses (A and B) that consist of 10 lessons each. Each lesson consists of one article (basically static HTML) and a couple of exercises.

Both courses are attended by about 15 people. I would sign them up so they’re all members. I wouldn’t give them back-end access but design a login form on the front-end. Initially all logged-in members of course A can only see lesson 1 of course A. The same goes for the members of course B. When someone finishes the exercises of lesson 1 of his course, I would manually give them access to lesson 2 etc. until they can see all the content. (They would just email me when they finished a lesson.)

That means it could be that member 1 has access to all lessons of his course, while member 2 only has access to lesson 1, 2 and 3. Etc.

How could I best tackle this scenario with Kirby? Simple outline is enough, the docs will help me further.

Ps i used kirby before but only just saw there's the auth plugin that will most likely be very helpful in my scenario.
