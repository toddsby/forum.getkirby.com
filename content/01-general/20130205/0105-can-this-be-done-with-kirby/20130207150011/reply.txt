Text: I would use YAML content for that:

    ----
    courses: 
      - photoshop
      - illustrator
    ----
    lessons:
      - photoshop: 5
      - illustrator: 7
    ----

This can be parsed in your template like this

```
<?php

$user    = auth::user();
$courses = yaml($user->courses());
$lessons = yaml($user->lessons());

?>
```

both will produce a nice array. afterward simply check if the user is allowed to access the current course and the current lesson and if not send him to the home page or wherever: 

```
<?php

// this can of course be dynamic
$course = 'photoshop';
$lesson = 5;

if(!in_array($course, $courses)) go(url());
if(!in_array($lesson, $lessons[$course])) go(url());

?>
```
