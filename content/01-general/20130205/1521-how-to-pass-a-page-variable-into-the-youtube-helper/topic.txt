Text: I am trying to pass the Videolink info from my .txt file into the Youtube Helper. I get nothing when I try to do it this way:

```
<?php echo youtube($page->Videolink()) ?>
```

Do I need to make a variable like this at the top of the page:

```
<? $videolink = $pages->Videolink(); ?>
```

and then pass it to the YouTube helper?

Thanks
