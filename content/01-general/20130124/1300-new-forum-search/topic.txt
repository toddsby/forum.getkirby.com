Text: Hey guys, 

I'm happy to announce that the forum finally has its own search. 
I think there's still space for improvements but I think this is a big step forward to make it easier to find stuff here :)

Can't wait to hear what you think about it. 
You can find the search in the little menu in the upper right corner, next to your profile name. 

Here's a direct link: <http://getkirby.com/forum/search>

Cheers, Bastian

P.S. what do you like to see in the forum next? Wishes?
