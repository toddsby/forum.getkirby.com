Text: I want to add a robots.txt file for my site, but Iâ€™m not sure what to include. Currently I have:

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /assets/
    Disallow: /kirby/
    Disallow: /site/
    Disallow: /stylesheets/

    sitemap: http://example.com.sitemap

Should I, or can I, also add stuff like:

    /archive/
    /tag:/

Not sure whether that last will work, as the URLs look like:

    http:/example.com/tag:tagname

where tagname is a single-word variable.

Any help appreciated.
