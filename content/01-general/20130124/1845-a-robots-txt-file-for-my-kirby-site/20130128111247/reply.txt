Text: I have ai-cache as I'm using Adaptive Images responsive images

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /ai-cache/
  
I have css (stylesheets etc) in assets...

    Disallow: /assets/ 

Then disallow some contents folders I don't want listed...

    Disallow: /content/error/
    Disallow: /content/login/
    Disallow: /content/offline/
    Disallow: /content/sitemap/
    Disallow: /content/test/
    Disallow: /content/updates/

The Kirby core and thumbs

    Disallow: /kirby/ 
    Disallow: /panel/
    Disallow: /site/
    Disallow: /thumbs/


And of course sitemap

    Sitemap: http://domain.com/sitemap.php


As for your other folders, I guess it depends on wether you want them to be read?
