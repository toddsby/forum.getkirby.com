Text: I'm trying to create galleries using Juicebox (juicebox.net), but it requires a config file. I can create this dynamically using PHP. Since Kirby blocks most locations, I can let this file live in the /assets directory, but that causes me to lose access to the $page variables which is where I'd like to pass the variables from.

I've looked into creating a plugin, snippet, etc, but I still have to have the javascript gallery access the config file which can only be in the /assets folder.

Anyone have any ideas or know of anyway to pass $page variables to a PHP file that isn't a snippet or plugin?

Thanks!
