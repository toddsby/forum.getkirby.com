Text: @DanielGenser right now you probably use `$page->url()` or in a loop probably something like `$article->url()`, right? 

Just change that in your templates to:

```
<?php echo url($page->uid()) ?>  
```

or in the loop:

```
<?php echo url($article->uid()) ?>  
```
(or whatever variable name you chose for your loop)

That should give you urls like: 

http://yourdomain.com/your-article
