Text: Hey all,

I have recently enabled multi-language support which is working pretty well [http://formitize.com/en/](http://formitize.com/en/) except for one major thing.

Since enabling it, seaching for a term here http://formitize.com/en/blog in the sidebar is sending the site into a redirect loop if I specify the target page as:

[http://formitize.com/en/search?q=test](http://formitize.com/en/search?q=test)

If I leave it as it was when no language was enabled, and send it here:

[http://formitize.com/search?q=test](http://formitize.com/search?q=test)

It redirects to the homepage (click on a tag to see that functionality).

Anyone encountered this before and have some ideas on how to solve this? It has baffled me all weekend.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Cheers
Adam
