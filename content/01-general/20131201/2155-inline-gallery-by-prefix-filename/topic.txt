Text: Hi, all!
I found this post on how to create inline galleries/slideshows:
Post: (link: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:45)
Gist: (link:https://gist.github.com/1711983)

It all works great! It enables me to create inline galleries by  typing **(gallery: image.jpg, image2.jpg)**

But:
Can anyone help me modify the code so that I can get all images based on a prefix/filename?

For example:
**(gallery: 2)** will would list all images that has *2-* in their filename. 

I have done the filtering part before by using the *filterBy*:
$page->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', '2-')

But I can't manage to integrate it into the existing code.

Thanks a lot!
