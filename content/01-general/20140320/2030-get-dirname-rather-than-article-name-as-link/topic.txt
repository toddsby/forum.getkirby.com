Text: Hi all,

In my site, I'm currently using
<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"></a>
to link to the relevant article pages, returning a url such as website.com/work/project-firstproject


Is there a way to keep the numeric system in the linking, i.e.,
website.com/work/01-project-firstproject

I'm running this in a PHP loop and it's missing the directories without the numeric part.


Much appreciated for any help.
