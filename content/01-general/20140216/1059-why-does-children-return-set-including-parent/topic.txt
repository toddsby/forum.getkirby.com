Text: I have page structure that looks like this:

    projects
      project1
      project2
      project3

When I do the following:

    $projects = $pages->find('projects')->children();
    foreach ($projects->visible() as $project) {
      echo $project->title()
    }

I get output that looks like this: 

    projectsproject1project2project3

that is, it includes the parent. This does not make sense to me. Is this intended, or am I doing something wrong here.
