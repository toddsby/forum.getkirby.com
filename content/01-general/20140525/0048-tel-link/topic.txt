Text: Hi, I’m trying to have a tel:1111111111 link. right now, here is my formatting with kirby text, but I get a relative link: http://mywebsite.com/tel:1111111111

    (link:tel:1111111111 text:+1 111 111-1111)

As I figured kirby text didn’t worked, I tried with

    Telephone: <a href="tel:1111111111">+1 111 111-1111</a>
    and
    <?php echo html($page->telephone()) ?>

But it won’t render as html; just plain text.
What am I doing wrong?
