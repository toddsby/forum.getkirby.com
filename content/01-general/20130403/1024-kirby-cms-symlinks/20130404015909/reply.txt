Text: I think the folder structure and the url are better than with the tagcloud, but tagcloud is a good solution too.

url for the post in cateogry-1: 

    mysite.com/blog/category-1/post-title/

url for the post in cateogry-2: 

    mysite.com/blog/category-2/post-title/

Maybe the duplicated content could cause some problems with search indexes but I think this is very common scenario, with other methods has the same problem, look at tagcloud solution:

url for the posts in category 1:

    mysite.com/blog/category:cateogry-1

url for the post in category 1 could be:

    mysite.com/blog/post-title/categroy:category-1

url for the post in category 2 could be:

    mysite.com/blog/post-title/categroy:category-2

Different url same content again...
