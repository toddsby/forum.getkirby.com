Text: This is my site structure:

1. Home
2. Page A
-- 2.1 Child A
-- 2.2 Child B
-- 2.3 Child C
(etc.)

On Page A, I would like to display thumbnails of the first image in every child folder. The thumbnails should link to the child pages. How do I do that? I am unfamiliar with PHP so I would appreciate any help.
