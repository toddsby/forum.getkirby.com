Text: Hello guys,

Does anyone know how this could be achieved using a foreach loop?

I'm trying to upload a video to kirby using the panel and this is to be displayed in a section called intro.

However, if there is no video uploaded how would i go about displaying an image that's been uploaded.

This is my code as it stands at the moment:

     <?php foreach ($pages->findByUID('intro') as $intro): ?>
     <?php if($intro->hasImages()): ?> 
     <?php foreach($intro->images() as $image): ?>

     <section id="intro" class="intro full">

     <video class="vidbg" preload="auto" autoplay="true" loop="loop" muted volume="0">
     <source src="" type="video/webm"/>
     <source src="" type="video/mp4"/>
     </video> 
                    
     <?php endforeach ?>
     <?php endif?>
     <?php endforeach ?>
     </section>

At present this will show me a video if i manually type in the URL but i would prefer to be able to upload either a video or a image and display which ever one is uploaded.


Many thanks :)
