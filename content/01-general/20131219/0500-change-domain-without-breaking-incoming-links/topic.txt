Text: Anyone know if that's possible? 

I've been blogging under myname.com for years, but I'm moving all of that content to Kirby, and I'd like to start writing that blog under a different domain. 

So, my question is whether it's possible to automatically bounce someone looking for http:myname.com/blog/post12 to http://newdomain.com/blog/post12 

Thanks
