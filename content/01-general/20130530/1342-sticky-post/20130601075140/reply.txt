Text: Yep, possible.. Haven't tested, but theoretically, this should work through panel's custom field. Maybe make a drop-down of sticky to either ***on*** or ***off*** on the **parent page** of all your posts (this becomes your switch). Then your posts have custom ticker that says this post is the "**sticky post**" (you get to choose which post is the sticky post).

Now on your template that displays posts, first filter out if current page has sticky posts ***on*** or ***off***. If it's on: 

- get the UID of the ***first*** post in your array of posts that has a field "**sticky post**"  - if user accidentally have 2 sticky posts, it'll choose the first one. (hint: `$var = $pages->findBy($key, $value)->first()->uid()`)
- display the post with the UID (hint: `$pages->findByUID($var)`)
- display the rest of the posts without the post with UID (hint: `$pages->not($var)`)

Else, display all posts normally chronologically.

Hope this helps.
