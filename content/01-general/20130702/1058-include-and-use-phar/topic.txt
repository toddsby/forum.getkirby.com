Text: Hi everybody,

i'm using Guzzle in my project (https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle),
to make calls to an api, works perfect in localhost,
but on my server, i got an error :

my code, (in snippets/mailing-connect.php):

include('guzzle.phar');
use Guzzle&#92;Http&#92;Client;
use Guzzle&#92;Http&#92;Exception&#92;BadResponse&#92;Exception;
use Guzzle&#92;Common&#92;Event;

the error :

      Fatal error: Class 'GuzzleHttpClient' not found in home/www/aa26cff23d6b766543aecc7ad849406c/web/dev/site/snippets/mailing-connect.php on line 12

kind of rooting problem i think,
but i'm learning php with kirby, tried many solutions but can't make it workâ€¦
Any idea?
thanks very much
