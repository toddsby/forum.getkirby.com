Text: I'm not sure exactly how I'd go about this, but I would imagine you could use PHP to save the initial returned list of items as session data, and then pull that in and paginate it using the Kirby pagination functions.

You'd have to have something checking for that data and generate it if it doesn't exist, because if someone ended up going directly to page 2, for example, and you were only generating the session data list on the first page, they'd see nothing.
