Text: Hi,

I want to make a Grid System that is based on Kirbytext or Markdown. In my head it should look like this:

    (column: 2/1)One column of two(/column)
    (column: 2/1)One column of two(/column)

or

    (column: 4/1)One column of four(/column)
    (column: 4/2)Two columns of four(/column)
    (column: 4/1)One column of four(/column)

and become

    <div class="column_two_one">One column of two</div>
    <div class="column_two_one">One column of two</div>

or

    <div class="column_four_one">One column of four</div>
    <div class="column_four_two">Two columns of four</div>
    <div class="column_four_one">One column of four</div>

With this code you should make different grids with 2, 3, or 4 columns. Now my question: Is it possible to do this with the **kirbytext.extended.php**? I know how to make new tags but in this case you doesn't have just one tag with different attributes but rather two tags in brackets within a long text passage like every normal html code. I found out that I have to use _Regular Expressions_ for this. Theoretically it's the same like _italic_ or **bold** markdown and I also found the position in the **kirbytext.php** (Line 93) but I'm designer and not a programmer, so my skills end here.

Thanks for your help
