Text: Hi,

thanks for your replies. I saw the princip in a wordpress theme (http://demo.udthemes.com/cartel/wordpress/) where you can generate grids with shortcodes and thought it is very nice and fast to use. On the other hand you're right about the division of content and layout.

_@texnixe_ Your first suggestion is to use several content files for every new column system. I would prefer to have one content file for each site like your second suggestion. You wrote _"[...] or use several variables in the content files"_. I don't really know how to handle this. Is it possible that you could make a short example for me? That would be great!

Thanks again,

Aaron
