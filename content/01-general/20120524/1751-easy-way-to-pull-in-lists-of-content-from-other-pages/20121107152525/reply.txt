Text: You'll need a loop within a loop. First loop pulling the children, second loop pulling the grandchildren. There's a discussion about this here http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:140

My first code example on that page should do the trick:


    <?php foreach($page->children() as $child): ?>
    <!-- do something with the children -->
        <?php foreach($child->children() as $grandchild): ?>
        <!-- do something with the grandchildren -->
        <?php endforeach ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>
