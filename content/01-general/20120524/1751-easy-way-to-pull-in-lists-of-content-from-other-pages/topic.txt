Text: So lets say I have a Products page, and then a couple layers down I have Appliances with subpages.

(pretty much this http://www.joyentcloud.com/products/ and this http://www.joyentcloud.com/products/appliances/)

I haven't run across this in the documentation yet, although it's probably thereâ€¦

1. On the appliances page, I want to pull the list of items underneath it, including the thumbnail images associated with each one). I assume that this should be easy enough?
2. On the Products page, I want to pull the appliances list. So they're not direct children of Products, but grandchildren. Possible?
