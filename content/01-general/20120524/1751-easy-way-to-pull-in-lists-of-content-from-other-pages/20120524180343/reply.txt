Text: Yep, sure! That's no problem. You can access anything from anywhere. 

The appliances page is easy. You can simply do something like: 

```

<?php foreach($page->children() as $appliance): ?>

<img src="<?php echo $appliance->images()->first()->url() ?>" />
<?php echo kirbytext($appliance->text()) ?>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

To gather all grandchildren on the products page you could do a nested foreach loop.

```

<?php foreach($page->children() as $child) ?>
<!-- maybe do something with the child data here -->

<?php foreach($child->children() as $grandchild): ?>
<!-- grandchildren html -->
<?php endforeach ?>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

Or you can access specific children and grandchildren like this: 

```php

<?php 

// version A
$grandchild = $page->children()->find('appliances')->children()->find('mongodb');

// version B
$grandchild = $page->children()->find('appliances/mongodb');

?>

```

I hope this helps
