Text: If you want people to actually end up posting to your local staged copy instead of the live server, you could use something like a symbolic link that should sync folders via dropbox even if they're actually outside your Dropbox.

My current setup has the entire sites for my localhosted sites in Dropbox, so if I want to share a content folder that way, I could easily do it because it's already in dropbox, no symbolic linking required.

If I want other people to post directly to the server, though, I'd have to install dropbox on the server, which my not be possible on my SmartOS-based servers.
