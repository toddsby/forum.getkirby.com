Text: The other solution using your existing code without the Kirby helper method would be to just put a slash in front of the paths.

So the lines you had before would be come this:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/skel-noscript.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/style.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/style-desktop.css" />
