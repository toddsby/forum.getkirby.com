Text: Hi all,

I'm currently having this rather annoying problem to get Kirby works on live VPS server.

I do my dev locally using MAMP and everything works fine. So, today I've decided to roll it out to my staging server on a VPS.

## The Problem 
All pages **except** home returns me a 404. 

### What I've done before I posted this question:
1. checked if the right .htaccess was uploaded and it was
1. checked if my config.php has `c::set('rewrite', true);` - and it has
1. checked my apache virtualhost setup to see if there are conflicts

Anyone has a suggestion on how to troubleshoot this?

#### VPS configuration:
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Apache2
- PHP 5.4.6-1ubuntu1.2

Thanks

### UPDATES
I think the culprit is the rewrite module. When I set `c::set('rewrite', false);` the site works

I did a check on VPS to see if rewrite module was enabled. I think, it is based on the output below


		~> apache2ctl -M

Checked my virtualhost settings on `etc/apache2/sites-available`

### Kirby .htaccess file


		# rewrite rules
		
		<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

			# block all files in the site folder from being accessed directly
			RewriteRule ^site/(.*) error [R=301,L]
		
			# block all files in the kirby folder from being accessed directly
			RewriteRule ^kirby/(.*) error [R=301,L]

### Things I've tried with the same configurations as above
1. set `c::set('url', false)` **AND** `c::set('rewrite', true)` as per kirby default settings = 404 error
2. set `c::set('url', '/')` **AND** `c::set('rewrite', true)` = 404 error
3. set `c::set('url', 'http://www.doman.com')` **AND** `c::set('rewrite', true)` = 404 error
4. any of the above 3 combi **AND** `c::set('rewrite', true)` = OK

Obviously, all my site inner pages urls now has `http://domain.com/index.php/page-name` which is not as readable.
