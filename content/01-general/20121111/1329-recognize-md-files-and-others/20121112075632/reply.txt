Text: Hi there!

Thanks - I'll check out Mou, it looks promising for a desktop app. The live preview in particular looks useful.

I made a mistake! It turns out iA Writer *does* allow me to save as .txt, even on iOS. I somehow managed to miss the fact that it allows me to set an extension when saving the file.

So for now, this is done and dusted. It might remain useful for future Kirby versions, if it decides to go for a more descriptive format, too.
