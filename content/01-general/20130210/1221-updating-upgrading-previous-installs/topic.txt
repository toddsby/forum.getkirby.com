Text: I know there's been a few new pushes to the CMS and the Panel over the past few days and that newer versions are due out too over the next few weeks. 

So, let's say I have some sites live that have used previous versions of Kirby. What's the best way to update these? 

Cheers folks, keep up the AWESOME stuff.
