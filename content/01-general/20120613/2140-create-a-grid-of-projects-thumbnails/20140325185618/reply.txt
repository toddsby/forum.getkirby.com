Text: Hello,
How would I go about using this alongside the thumb plugin? What I want to do is show the thumbnail rather than full size image. Im totally confused when it comes to php!
Thanks so much.

Edit -  this is as close as i can get:


    <ul>
    <?php foreach($page->children() as $project): ?> 
    <li>      
    <a href="<?php echo $project->url() ?>"><img src="<?php echo thumb($project->images()->first(), array('width' => 280, 'height' => 280, 'crop' => true))?>" alt="<?php echo html($project->title()) ?>" /><?php echo html($project->title()) ?></a>
    </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>  
    </ul>


DOUBLE EDIT... I managed to fixit but don't know how to delete this post.
