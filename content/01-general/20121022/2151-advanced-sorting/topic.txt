Text: Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out how to do some tricky sorting of children pages and having a tough time getting something to work.

The area of the site is for company press and the goal is for the Press page to show a paginated list of all the Press Articles. I need to sort them in a particular order, though:

1. Featured is **on**, _put these in chronological order_
2. Featured is **off** _and_ article **has text**, _put these in chronological order_
3. Featured is **off** and article **doesn't** have text, _put these in chronological order_

All of this needs to be paginated.


Here's what my pressarticle.txt looks like:

    Title: Deck the halls
    ----
    Date: 11.08.2010
    ----
    Text: Sample text blah blah blah
    ----
    Featured: on


I keep getting caught up in a weird mix of the filterBy and sortBy functions and I think I'm over analyzing it.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
