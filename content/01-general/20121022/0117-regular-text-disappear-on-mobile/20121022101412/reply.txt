Text: I think Russell has some great advice here. 

I also ran into some strange problems related to optimizeLegibility in combination with webfonts a few times and I think I will remove that rule from the default theme soon. 

But in general such CSS problems shouldn't be related to Kirby as long as the produced HTML is correct. If there's a problem with that p tag caused by kirbytext, please let me know.
