Text: There are a few ways to go about it, depending on the extent of the differences in the themes.

You could have a base CSS file, and then have other CSS files loaded based on the template used. Or you could apply a body class based on template, and then apply styling based on the body class.

I'd use the first method if they are significant differences, and the second if they are more minor.
