Text: I am currently using the thumb snippet to auto-generate a thumbnail for each of my projects in a portfolio. However, some of those thumbnails are not the best.

How would I write an if/then statement to search for a specified thumb.jpg file in a project directory, and if that file is not found, then use the thumb snippet to create one?=

Thanks for the help.
