Text: It depends on how many sub-sections you have to how you do this. Personally I only have three, so I pull the page object into a couple of arrays, which then allow me to multisort by date, like this:

```//create the array of things for the homepage.
$things = array();
$dates = array();

foreach($pages->findByUID('blog')->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'desc') as $article):
	$things[] = $article;
	$dates[] = $article->date();
endforeach;
foreach($pages->findByUID('work')->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'desc') as $article):
	$things[] = $article;
	$dates[] = $article->date();
endforeach;
foreach($pages->findByUID('gallery')->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'desc') as $article):
	$things[] = $article;
	$dates[] = $article->date();
endforeach;

array_multisort($dates, SORT_DESC, $things);```

This then gives me an array of date sorted objects from each of my three main sections which I can loop through. I guess you could do something similar and skim the most recent off the top.
