Text: So you’re trying to add a favicon and the Google Fonts code to your templates?

You can do that just as you would when building a vanilla HTML file.

I’m not sure what your level of PHP knowledge is, but PHP is just (link: http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php#faq.general.what text: an HTML-embedded scripting language). Meaning, you’re PHP tags just sit inside all your normal HTML.

With most templates, the `<head>` element—which is where your favicon and Google Fonts code should go—can be found in a snippet file usually called `header.php`.

**Edit**: Just saw your post that went up minutes before this.

No need to transform that `<link>` element into PHP. The CSS one your outputting is just a helper that’s built-in to Kirby.
