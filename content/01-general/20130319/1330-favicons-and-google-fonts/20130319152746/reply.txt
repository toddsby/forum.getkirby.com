Text: Hi. No, I am not. It's my own website in development. I figured out the Google Fonts part:

`<?php echo css('http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Questrial') ?>`

However, I don't know how to turn the favicon html:

`<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="img/favicon.ico" />`

to similar php code as the Google Fonts one
