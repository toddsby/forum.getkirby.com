Text: Instead of putting the images in a foreach, you should be able to use `->first()`

Like this:

    <?php if($item->hasImages()): ?>
        <?php $image = $item->images()->first() ?>
        <a href="<?php echo $item->url() ?>">
        <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $image->title() ?>"></a>


etc. But what exactly was your question? Were you having a problem with the existing code?
