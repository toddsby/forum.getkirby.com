Text: My code

    <?php $cats= $pages->find('cat1', 'cat1/subcat1')->children()->not('about')->not('contact')->not('cookies'); ?>

I tried this with no luck

    <?php $cats= $pages->find('cat1', 'cat1/subcat1')->children()->not(array('about', 'contact', 'cookies')); ?>

Is there another way? It's ok for me this time but sometime I might have 20 pages to be excluded.

Sure, I can make an own loop. It there a built in way? I could not find one.
