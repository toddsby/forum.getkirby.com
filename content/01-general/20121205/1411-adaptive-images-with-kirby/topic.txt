Text: There is a very nice tool (link:http://adaptive-images.com text:Adaptive Images popup: yes) witch helps to serve a different size of images based on screen sizes. The tool is using a two `adaptive-images.php`, `.htaccess` files. And this little script:

```js
<script>document.cookie='resolution='+Math.max(screen.width,screen.height)+'; path=/';</script>
```

Anyone was able to integrate it?
