Text: I seem to have issues when having multiple date fields in a blueprint.

The content is for an event. Each event has two dates: a start date and an end date.

In my Event blueprint I use:

    startdate:
      label: Start Date
      type: date
      format: mm/dd/yy
    enddate:
      label: End Date
      type: date
      format: mm/dd/yy

The blueprint works great in the panel, I get two date selector fields and everything is good.

I add the two dates in my template like so:

    <?php echo $event->startdate('F j, Y') ?>

    <?php echo $event->enddate('F j, Y') ?>

When it refuses to render the proper PHP date format.

I want the date to look like this: January 24, 2013
But the template will only render: 01/24/2013

When I remove the second date from the blueprint and template, and only have ONE date field, everything works fine.

Is there a bug not allowing two or more dates?
