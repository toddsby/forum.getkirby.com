Text: I’m trying to set up Twitter cards for my blog. The only part that’s giving me a problem is the `twitter:url`. I’m using:

    <meta name="twitter:url" content="<?php echo $page->url() ?>"> 

This returns:

    http://example.com/blog/article-name

But ‘blog’ is always stripped/redirected for pages on my blog. How can I strip ‘blog/’ from the ‘page->url’?
