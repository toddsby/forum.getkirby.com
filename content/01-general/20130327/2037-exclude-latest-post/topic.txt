On my blogpage i want to show:
- latest post/article opened
- a list of titles of the last 5 posts

I managed to list the first post.
My problem is that i don't know how to exclude the latest post from the list of titles below? can anyone help. Must be so easy but i'm really a beginner.

Thanks in advance!
