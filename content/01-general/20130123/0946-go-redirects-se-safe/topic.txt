Text: Hi,
can anyone put my mind to rest about the go() redirect? I am currently using it to jump directly from a top level menu-item onto a sub-level child-page, and I am wondering whether I should not better use an htaccess redirect to make it more search-engine transparent. Anyone know more about this?
