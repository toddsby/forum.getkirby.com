Text: With Kirby Panel, is it possible to:

1. Upload image/resize images?

2. Create/edit blog article by automatically creating the folder and txt file?

Love the way Kirby works, because I like working with Vim text editor and FTP, but don't know if it will be suitable for my clients that don't have these knowledge.

Thank you!
