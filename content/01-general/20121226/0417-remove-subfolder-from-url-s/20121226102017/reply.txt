Text: There is one way that *could* work: Set the `subfolder` as your homepage in `site/config/config.php`. You can then access your pages like you want.

But my question is: Why do you need that? You can also just put the articles folder in the root of the `content` folder.
Or is there a specific reason why you need that structure?
