Text: Are you after a submenu for the current page?
```php
<?php 
// find the open/active page on the first level
$open  = $pages->findOpen();
$items = ($open) ? $open->children()->visible() : false; 
?>
```
You can then loop through the results ($items) for you menus. There is a submenu snippet.
