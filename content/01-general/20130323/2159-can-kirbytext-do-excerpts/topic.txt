Text: What I'd like to do is present excerpts of blog articles on my main blog page. `excerpt()` will do some of what I need, but it strips the formatting (HTML or Markdown) and I want to keep the formatting (Markdown, in my case).

Will `kirbytext()` take a length parameter?

Is there another trick to extract the first portion of an article and feed that to `kirbytext()`?
