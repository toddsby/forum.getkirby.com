Text: So, after a bit of fiddling, I came up with a work around by stealing a technique from WordPress. It uses the `<!--more-->` tag as a way to signal its post excerpt engine where to split a post.

So I created a `kirbytext()` extension to do the same with a `(more:)` tag.

My kirbytext.extended.php file looks like this:

```PHP
<?php
class kirbytextExtended extends kirbytext {
	function __construct($text, $markdown=true) {
		parent::__construct($text, $markdown);
		// define the custom 'more' tag
		$this->addTags('more');
	}
	// define that the 'more' tag returns nothing
	function more($params) {
		return ("");
	}
}
?>```

My loop for my main block pages looks like this:

```PHP
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>
	<article>
		<h1><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></h1>
		<?php
		$theText = $article->text();
		if (strpos($theText, '(more:)') === FALSE) {
			echo kirbytext($theText);
		} else {
			echo kirbytext(strstr($theText, '(more:)', true));
			echo '<a href=' . $article->url() . '>Read moreâ€¦</a>';
		}
		?>
	</article>
<?php endforeach ?>```

I'm sorry my code is all compressed. I haven't quite figured out the syntax for good markdown. [Edit: Now my code looks right thanks to @plartz who commented below]

Maybe that will help someone trying to do the same thing. Or maybe there's even a better way?
