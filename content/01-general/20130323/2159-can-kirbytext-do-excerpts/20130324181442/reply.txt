I like that solution, too. I'm going to try that.

And on another related subject, images contained in the blog posts using `kirbytext()` don't appear on the blog summary page as they are interpreted relative to the blog post itself.

So [image: myimage.jpg] works fine in the article if my image.jpg is in the same folder as article.md, which it is.

But when the blog summary page grabs that part of the article.md file, it looks for the file in it's own folder, not in article.md's folder.

Is there a trick I'm missing?
