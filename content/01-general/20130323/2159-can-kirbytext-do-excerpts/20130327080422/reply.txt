Text: Sorry, that is because I forgot to escape my 'Kirby Text' image code (now corrected above), I just re-tried it with a 'KirbyText' image link and it works e.g.

<code>&#40;image: image1.jpg&#41;</code>

It does not appear to work with Markdown relative links e.g.

```kirby
![](image1.jpg)
```
