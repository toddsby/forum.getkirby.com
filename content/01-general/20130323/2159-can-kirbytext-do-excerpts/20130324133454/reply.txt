Text: I'm using the same solution as @richardhellyer for news systems. Advantage is that you can also serve a total different text/content, e.g. some more links, a simple list, table of contents, or just an summary of the text. It is often more useful then an excerpt.

@BobRockefeller just wrap your code with three backticks (assuming that the following apostrophes are backticks, so that you can see what I mean) and write the language right after the open backticks:

'''php
&lt;?php
// Echo hi
echo "hi";
?&gt;
'''

You'll get:

```php
<?php
// Echo hi
echo "hi";
?>
```
