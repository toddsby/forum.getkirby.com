Text: Hi guys, hope you are well and rockin' some good websites with kirby.

I want to ask for help with email plugin, specially with how to collect data from fields I have to send them to me.

If I will have form with two simple text inputs (text1 and text2) and submit button, how can I collect those two and show it in email body nicely?

Thank you!
