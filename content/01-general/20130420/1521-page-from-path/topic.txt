Text: Is it possible to get a Kirby page object ($page) if you know the file path to that page?

I'm writing a PHP script to be called from AJAX as a part of a Kirby page. A snippet works fine. But calling a PHP script from AJAX takes it out of the Kirby context so that I don't have access to Kirby variables. I'm not even sure I'll have access to Kirby functions, but one step at a time.
