Text: I'm using the related pages plugin, and since related items have to be manually typed in, I want to programmatically check that it's actually a valid item before acting on it, since everything breaks if it's not a valid item.

This would also be handy for those times where a related item gets deleted, and we forget all the places it's linked from.

Is there an easy way to do this? I tried checking if the item returned a uid from within the foreach loop, but apparently by that point it's too late.
