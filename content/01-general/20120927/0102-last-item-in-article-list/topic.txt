Text: I'm trying to get a list of articles and then determine which is the last one so I can not put a comma after it.

So I have something like this:

    <?php $partners = $page->children() ?>
    <?php $last = end($partners) ?>
    <?php foreach ($partners AS $partner) : ?>
        <?php echo $partner->uid() ?>
        <?php echo ($partner == $last) ? '' : ',' ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>

But it doesn't work. I used the same method on categories before, but that must have worked because it was already stripped down to an array of just words? Can I strip the $partners array down to just the uid() somehow?
