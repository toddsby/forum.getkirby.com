Text: I'm doing something similar to find the most recent blog article, to feature it on the home page:
<pre><code>
$project = $pages->find('blog')
$mostrecent = $project->children()
$last = $mostrecent->last()
</code></pre>
How would I target the 2nd to last article? Something like this? I'm not quite there yet...
<pre><code>
$project = $pages->find('blog')
$getkids = $project->children()
$howmany = $getkids->count()
</code></pre>
