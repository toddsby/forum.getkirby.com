Text: I'm trying to find a way to solve the below problem, I've read through the docs and can't think of the best way to do this. The problem is as below:

  - Use subpages to render content on a main page. 
  - The content will be different per page.
  - The content will be module based. 


To explain this further, I will show an example structure. 

    Content
        01-projects (projects.txt)
            01-example-project (project.txt)
                01-content-row (row.txt)
                    01-text-block (text-block.txt)
                    02-quote-block (quote-block.txt)
                02-content-row
                    01-quote-block (quote-block.txt)
            02-example-project
                01-content-row (row.txt)
                    01-text-block (text-block.txt)
                    

I want to render the HTML of each child txt, regardless of the fields. The HTML should output exactly as it would based on the template file it's related to. 

This way, one long page would be made up of the HTML elements defined in the folder structure. 

I've tried various solutions and I can only output specified fields, furthermore, they aren't output as HTML - they are output as plain text.

Thanks for your help in advance.

Dan.
