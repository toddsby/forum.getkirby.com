Text: Thanks for your reply, but it doesn't work. 

I want to display in a code block something like this:

    ( image:aaa.jpg )

(without the spaces) 

But using the character entities I get

    &lpar;image:aaa.jpg&rpar;

and if don't use them I get the kyrbytext tag converted to html:

    (image:aaa.jpg)
