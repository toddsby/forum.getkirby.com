Text: I'd like to show on my blog a few KirbyText extensions I've developed, but I can't avoid the tags to be parsed. 

I write inside the <pre> code block something like

    ( image:http://.... )

and I'm expecting exactly the same text to be rendered on the page; but the tag is parsed and between the <pre> tags I find 

    <image source:http//..... >

Where's the trick?
