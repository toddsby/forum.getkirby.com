Text: Is there a way in the Kirby API to edit variables stored in a page's .txt files?

Right now I'm writing a short script that changes the inventory of an item after a purchase, via a XML data feed, that does some string searching and replacement - not a huge task or problem, but, the neater side of me would like to dig into this using Kirby.

Any thoughts?
