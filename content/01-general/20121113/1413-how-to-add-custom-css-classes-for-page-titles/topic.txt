Text: Is there a way to add custom classes to the menue.php, for each list-item? I found that of markdown extra [1]  allows to add custom id-attributes to headers, like this:

        ### my heading ### {#custom-id}

unfortunatly this works only for the contents but not for the menue. 

I would love to add individual classes directly in the corresponding title-tag of my text-documents, i.e.:

       Title: About 	{.css-class-for-about}
       Text: ...

Any chance to add this into kirby?

Perhaps there is another simple solution I've not found yet, e.g. by customizing site/snippets/menue.php ?!
