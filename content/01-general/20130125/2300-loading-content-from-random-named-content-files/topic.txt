Text: Hi,

I wrote a script that scrapes content from several social media sources into randomly named text files which are stored under a certain directory within kirby's "content" folder. The folder structure looks similar to this:

content/
  socialmedia/
    12345678.txt
    23443543.txt
    66545644.txt
    ...

The text files are already structured in a key-value fashioned way like:

"created_at: Mon Jan 07 08:52:11 +0000 2013

----
id: xxx

----
text: Foobar

----"

I'm now facing the problem how to read this files and displaying their content.

I tried the following:
$pages->findByDirname("socialmedia")
but it doesn't fetch me the files and their content.

I only can load them as "files". But how can I access the content when treating them as "file" and not as page?

Thanks for your help!
