Text: Hi all,

I'm looking to output only the first image of the images uploaded to a page. I know you can do this for files, but wondered if it's possible for images. Didn't seem to work for me - this is what I have:

    <?php foreach($pages->children()->visible() as $project): ?>
			<div class="sixcol">
				<ul class="landing-project-list">
					<?php foreach($project->images()->first() as $image): ?>
						<li><img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" /></li>
					<?php endforeach ?>
				</ul>
			</div>
     <?php endforeach ?>
