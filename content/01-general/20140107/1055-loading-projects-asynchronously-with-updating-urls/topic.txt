Text: I would like to create a one-pager, but with updating URLs, using some sort of hash router or a framework like Angular.js. Anyway, what I want is to code it so, that the website runs from the homepage and loads pages and projects asynchronously. So let's say I go to `http://www.mysite.com/projects/my-first-project`, I want it to land on the index.php (and *not* on the project page) and then load My First Project asynchronously. 

Any thoughts on this? Thanks!
