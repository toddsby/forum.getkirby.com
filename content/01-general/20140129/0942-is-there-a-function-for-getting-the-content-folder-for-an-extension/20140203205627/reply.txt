Text: Hi,
have you looked at (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/the-mighty-mighty-uri-object text: the mighty uri object)? That should give you any path in your site. Otherwise you may want to do something with the file path. $file->root() should give you the root path of the file on your server. You could then parse that with php string functions.
That is just what comes to my mind just know. There is probably a better way to do it :-)
I take it that using the php function echo $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] is not what you are after?
