Text: Hi,
thanks for your thoughts. I wrote an plugin which is capsuled in a php class which I call inside a snippet.
If call the $site->uri as a var but I got error messages:

Notice: Undefined variable: site in
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in

What do I'm wrong or how can I use it inside an plugin?
