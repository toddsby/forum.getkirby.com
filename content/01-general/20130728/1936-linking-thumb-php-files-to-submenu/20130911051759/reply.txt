Text: I got this error:

    Fatal error: Call to a member function width() on a non-object in
    /Users/karlnoelle1/Sites/kirby/site/plugins/thumb.php on line 40

and line 40 of that file is this:

        $this->sourceWidth  = $this->obj->width();

I'm at the point where I don't think the thumb.php plugin is necessary...probably more trouble than its worth and I'm definitely capable of sizing images myself since it wouldn't be a very common task. Thank you for all your troubleshooting thoughâ€”it's very appreciated!
