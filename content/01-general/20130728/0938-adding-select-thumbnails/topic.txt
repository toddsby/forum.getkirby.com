Text: I've managed to combine Masonry with the thumbnail plugin and filterby() to create a grid of "featured" projects in my default.php.

It's all working well: If I add 'tags: pick' to any project's project.txt file, Kirby finds it and creates a thumbnail from the first image in the set. 

(I don't know if this is necessary, but to get Masonry working with the thumbnail plugin, there is an invisible .png that is used in the <img> tag)

Here's the working code:

<pre>
<code>



&ltdiv id="featmasonry" class="js-masonry" data-masonry-options='{ "columnWidth": 270, "itemSelector": ".featthumb" }'&gt
	&ltul&gt

&lt?php foreach($pages-&gtfind('artists')-&gtchildren()-&gtchildren()-&gtfilterby('tags', 'pick', ',') as $pick): ?&gt
	&ltdiv class="featthumb"&gt

		&lt?php $image = $pick-&gtimages()-&gtfirst()?&gt

		&lt?php $image-&gtfitWidth(250) ?&gt
			&ltdiv class="thumbImg"&gt
			&ltli&gt
				&lta href="&lt?php echo $pick-&gturl() ?&gt" title="&lt?php echo $pick-&gttitle() ?&gt"&gt&ltimg src="/assets/images/img.png" width="&lt?php echo $pick-&gtfiles()-&gtfirst()-&gtwidth() ?&gt" height="&lt?php echo $pick-&gtfiles()-&gtfirst()-&gtheight() ?&gt" alt="&lt?php echo $pick-&gttitle() ?&gt" class="invisible" /&gt&lt?php echo thumb($image, array('width' =&gt 250)) ?&gt&lt/a&gt
			&lt/li&gt&lt/div&gt
			&ltdiv class="thumbInfo"&gt&ltp&gt&lt?php echo $pick-&gtptitle ?&gt&lt/p&gt&lt/div&gt
		
	&lt/div&gt
	
&lt?php endforeach ?&gt
	&lt/ul&gt
&lt/div&gt
</code>
</pre>

But, there is one more thing I would like to add - the ability to include a <em>second</em> (or third or fourth...) thumbnail from a project - because right now, it's only using the first.

I would also like to be able to do this using meta info via an additional .txt file linked to a particular image. This may not be the easiest way with the code, but I'm building this for a client who will already be editing the meta-.txt files, and I'd like this to be as simple as possible for her.

So, my project folder may look like this:

/01-necklace/
	01-necklace-red.jpg
	01-necklace-red.jpg.txt
	02-necklace-orange.jpg
	02-necklace-orange.jpg.txt
	03-necklace-yellow.jpg
	03-necklace-yellow.jpg.txt
	04-necklace-green.jpg
	04-necklace-green.jpg.txt
	05-necklace-blue.jpg
	05-necklace-blue.jpg.txt
	06-necklace-violet.jpg
	06-necklace-violet.jpg.txt
	project.txt

If I've included 'tags: pick' in both project.txt and 06-necklace-violet.jpg.txt, they would be displayed as thumbnails in default.php

BONUS: what if I wanted to display only 06-necklace-violet.jpg and not the first image?

any thoughts? Thanks in advance ~ ~
