Text: I have a gallery of thumbnails that pulls the 1st image from child galleries. 

I am trying to link the thumbs to each gallery ("01-gallery" through "04-gallery")…

...

php echo $child->url() 
...

Every thumb links to the same child "04-gallery" - the last child??

Seems easy enough, but can't make it work…
