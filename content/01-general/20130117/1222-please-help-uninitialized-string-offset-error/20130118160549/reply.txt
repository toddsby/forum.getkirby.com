Text: Sorry for the delay, Russ, and thanks for your input. Yes, I am getting this error with the default install code. I only changed this code for URL rewrite on the config.php file in the 'site' folder:

c::set('rewrite', false);

I want to switch to the new XAMPP then give it a shot to see if the error message disappears
