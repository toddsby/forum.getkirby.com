Text: I think that could work, with a slightly different bit of code, but is it worth it? I got round it by setting first & prev/next & last arrow buttons and then have the range center around the middle few. The current one in bold and disable the first/prev if you are on the first item and the next/last if you are on the last.
*Five*
**|< <<  03 04** *05* **06 07  >> >|**

*Six*
**|< <<  04 05** *06* **07 08  >> >|**

*First*
|< <<  01 **02 03 04 05 >> >|**

*Last*
**|< <<  04 05 06 07** *08*  >> >|


Saves space and works as well? I guess you could also show the first and last items in the list if you are not on them, but is it worth it if you have link arrows?
