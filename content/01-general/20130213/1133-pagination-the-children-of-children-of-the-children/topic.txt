Text: Dear all,

Hope you can assist me with the following, my structure is as follows. Al the events are stored in the event folder under series as event.txt

events

- maincat1
-- series1
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
--- event4
-- series2
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
etc.

- maincat2
-- series1
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
--- event4
-- series2
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
etc.

- maincat3
-- series1
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
--- event4
-- series2
--- event1
--- event2
--- event3
-- series3
--- event1
--- event2
etc.


When I want to to show all the events in the main-events page, no problem, it all works, also with the pagination. 

One and other works also [included pagination] when I want to show a certain serie; I made a template for it.

I call them with: <code>articles = $page->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'asc')->paginate(10);$pagination = $articles->pagination;$range = 5;	</code>

I also would like to show all series from a certain maincat, this also works, but the pagination partly works:
- when I query <code> $articles = $page->children()->children()->visible()->sortBy('date', 'asc')->paginate(15);$pagination = $articles->pagination;$range = 5;</code>	

In this test case I have 12 events and it's show the 12 events and also the pagination shows: 12 results, showing 1-12.

When I adjust paginate into 5, I got a blanc page. When I adjust the query into pages, then I recevie al the names of the series-folders on the screen.

What am I doing wrong?

I already searched the forum, looked at topics as http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:140 and http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:11


EDIT:
From the main-event page I also work with tags, so I alreay can sort on the main categories, but I would also like to have a seperate main-page for the different main-categories, from there I can have also a next query to countries etc.

SOLUTION FOR NOW

I used for the overview pages for the main categories:
<code>->filterBy('tags', 'Autosport', ',')</code>

I think there is a other solution but it does the job for now
