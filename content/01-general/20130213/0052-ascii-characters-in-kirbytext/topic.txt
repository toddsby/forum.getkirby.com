Text: If this is in my txt file:

title: Acme Industries (ascii symbol for trademark)

And this is in my markup:

<code>&#60;h1&#62;&#60;?php echo html( $page-&#62;title() ) ?&#62;&#60;/h1&#62;</code>

The ASCII characters are rendered, instead of the trademark symbol. How is this accomplished correctly?

Thanks!
