Text: As part of a project I'm developing, I will need a sort of paywall. Do you think it would be possible to achieve the paywall-related functions I'd need with a (customized) Kirby Authentication Plugin?

The functions I'd need would be :

* Account creation
* Authentication : Login/Logout (_already covered with the plugin_)
* Payment (_through PayPal I guess?_)
  Upgrade of the account group after payment (_groups are covered_)
* Limit the availability of pages consumed for a special group (_covered with the custom variables : one is the last active month, the other is the number of pages consumed, reset if last active month is not the current month_)



What I'm looking for in this thread is not ready-to-work solutions, I'd like to know if anyone thinks it's possible, and how easy/hard you think it would be.

General estimations and guesses are OK!
