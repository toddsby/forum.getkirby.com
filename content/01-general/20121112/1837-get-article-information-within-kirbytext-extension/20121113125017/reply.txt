Text: The best way to do that is to use the following code inside a kirbytext method: 

```php

if(!$this->obj) {
  global $site;      
  $currentPage = $site->pages()->active();
} else {
  $currentPage = $this->obj;
}

```

Normally the related page object is stored in `$this->obj` but in case it is missing you can still get the current active page instead. 

I hope this helps.
