Text: OK, that looks like it should work. But now I think I'm having trouble getting a kirbytext extension set up correctly for this. I've done a simpler one before.

You know what would make a great tutorial? Showing me how to duplicate the functionality of, say, the default vimeo parser as a kirbytext extension.

But I'll continue to try to get it working.
