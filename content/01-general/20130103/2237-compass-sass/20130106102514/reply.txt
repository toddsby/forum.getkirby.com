Text: Yes that is right, I have a pile of Less files (in your case scss) files in a styles folder and Codekit compiles them to a single file in the same folder which I then link to in my Kirby template. Same goes for quite a few of Javscript files which can be combined.

Make sure you have Codekit running and compiling and check where it is compiling to. I keep everthing Less and compiled CSS files in the 'styles' folder indicated above.
