Text: Hey Zach,

I've had the same problem myself. I tried a myriad of options and finally discovered a trick that works perfect for Kirbytext.

Kirby comes prepackaged with Markdown Extra, an enhanced version of PHP Markdown. One of the really nice features of Markdown Extra is "fenced code blocks". They work as follows:

<code>~~~~~~~ 
This is code
~~~~~~~ </code>

One of the really amazing features of this is that Markdown Extra gives you the ability to specify a class to apply to the code block, overwriting the defaults chosen by Markdown.

So, assuming you have Prettify css and js in your assets folder, as well as the required script and css links in your template, you can do the following:

- Edit your ./site/config/config.php and set <code>c::set('markdown.extra', true);</code>

This will turn on Markdown Extra and allow you to use the fenced code blocks.

In your content file, you will now do something like this:

<code>~~~~~ {.prettyprint .linenums}
&#35;/etc/aliases
mailer-daemon: postmasterpostmaster: root
nobody: roothostmaster: root
usenet: root
news: rootwebmaster: root
www: root
ftp: rootabuse: root
noc: root
security: rootclamav: root
root: john_doe(@)example.com
~~~~~</code>

Assuming the template is parsing the content file through kirbytext or markdown, you should now have a prettified code block.
