Text: If for instance, I create a page called "home" and its going to contain a list of subpages that are articles, when I click  an article, the url will be something like `my site.com/home/article-blah-blah`. Taking "home" out of the url actually works, but using `$page->url()` includes the "home" part, even if that page is the home page of the site. Anyway, either through a config value, or htaccess bit that doesn't show the "home" bit of subpage urls of the home page?
