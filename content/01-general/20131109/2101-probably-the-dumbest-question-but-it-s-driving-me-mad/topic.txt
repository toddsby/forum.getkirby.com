Text: Hi. I'm really really really sorry for what is probably going to be a real basic question for almost all of you. But I'm not a developer and not familiar with Github and can't figure something out.

Sooooâ€¦

I'm at this page on Github: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/contactform

Wanting to download the Contact Form plugin.

I have NO IDEA how to download the dang folder! I'm going mad looking for a download folder link or ANYTHING to download this. I've seen other pages with download links but how do I download this folder????

Anyway, I appreciate your help.

Thanks

Rob
