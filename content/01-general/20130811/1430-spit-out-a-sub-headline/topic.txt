Text: Hey folks,

I'm setting up my blog right now and every single post consists a headline + another sub-headline. So in the HTML markup it is a h1 and a h2.
I use the simple echo article->title to show my headline. Is there already a tag to use for a sub-headline? If not, how would you print out the sub-headline from your text files?

Thanks a lot.
