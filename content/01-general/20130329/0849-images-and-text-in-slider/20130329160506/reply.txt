Text: I don't think I'd be using HTML in a Markdown CMS :-) I presume you can actually do the slider bit as their are loads on the internet...

As **@roman_oroco** suggested, be more simple put them in different directories?
```html
01-myFolders
  01-myFolder1
     text.txt
     image.jpg
  02-myFolder2
     text.txt
     image.jpg
```    
And loop through normally?

If you want folder(s) with all the files in then loop through the `files()`, sort order could be more problematic for you depending on files name and required order...
Not tested, but something like (assuming a 'myFolders') with possible sub folders:

```php
<h3>Display Files in folders<h3> 
<ol>
  <?php foreach($pages->find('myFolders')->children() as $pagelist): ?>
    <?php foreach($pagelist->files() as $filelist ) : ?>
      <li>
        Name: <?php echo $filelist->name() ?><br/>
        URL:  <?php echo $filelist->url() ?>
      </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  <? endforeach ?>
</ol>
```
