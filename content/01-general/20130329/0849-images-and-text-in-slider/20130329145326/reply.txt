Text: Thank you, I already had a look at that tutorial, indeed a good explanation. 

But what I'm trying to do is looping and mixing through two arrays (images and separate text-files or text-fields). I'm looking into the MultipleIterator at the moment. Got some php learning to do (I'm used to working with ExpressionEngine tags).

I'm now using a custom text field for the text which I will try to mix in with the images â€¦
Any suggestions or examples are appreciated.
