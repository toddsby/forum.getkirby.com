Text: Look at what's in your arrays - I think it will become clearer ;-)

```php 
<?php echo a::show($articles) ?>
```

or what ever else you are using on your other pages. 

Basically I think you are filling the array with different things and hence the count will be different. If you limit to 1 - then your count will be 1...
