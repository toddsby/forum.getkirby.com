Text: Hey Russ, I only want to show one article on the homepage, so removing the 'limit(1)' would technically work, by showing the numbers depending on how many posts I have.

I've further discovered that when I choose to view only posts with a certain tag, the count changes again to match the amount of posts with that take rather then a global count. Its a little weird to explain but here it goes

Homepage - shows latest posts, count is 1
Blog page- shows all posts, count = all posts
tagged page - show post with that tag, count = the amount of posts with that tag.

What it should be is
Homepage with latest post, count = total number of posts

Hope that makes sense.
