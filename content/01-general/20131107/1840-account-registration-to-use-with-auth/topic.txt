Text: Hi,
I'm testing Kirby and I already love it, I'll buy it as soon as I'll have decided to use it.

I checked into the forum and I didn't find an answer to this: is there any custom implementation, or some ideas at least, to create an account registration form? As far as I understood, this would involve creating a new account-named php file containing all relevants fields (name, password etc.), is this correct? Is there anything already tested?

Thank you
