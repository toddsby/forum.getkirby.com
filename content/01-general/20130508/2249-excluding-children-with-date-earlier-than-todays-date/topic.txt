Text: I have a page called "Backlog" with many children. The children have a custom field called "Expirationdate" that's formatted like so: `2013-05-09`

I need to be able to:

1. Get a count of all children with an `Expirationdate` that’s `<` today’s date; and
2. Loop through all children with dates > `Expirationdate`.

Possible?
