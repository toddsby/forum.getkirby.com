Text: I would like to have two version of the same page, one for regular display, with some fancy **div** components and so on, and an other, using the same source page, for printing (no fancy stuff, just cleaner text arrangement).

Is it possible to call a different template for the same page (ideally through a "print" button)?

Thanks in advance.
