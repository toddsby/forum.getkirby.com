Text: Hi there! I'm sorry if the answer to my question is incredibly obvious, but I have not been able to find it so far and I'm driving myself a bit crazy.

I'm creating a website with template-specific CSS, and the layout I created needs the subpages to have the same CSS as their parents.

My question is: is there a way for the subpages to use the parent template and not the default? I know I can do two things:
- create a separate template for each subpage
- I can install Panel and add blueprints (I think)

However, I want to keep things as efficient as possible, and I don't feel like using Panel.


Thank you in advance for your replies!
