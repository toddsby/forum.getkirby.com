Text: Haha, I'm sorry guys! I know it sounds quite weird, especially without code samples.

I managed to fix it about a minute ago. I went with the method of renaming subpages, including the blog articles. I rewrote blog.php to include the elements needed for the single pages. Instead of returning the page title (I needed 'Blog Post 1', but nog 'Blog') I added a new textfield called 'singletitle'.

It's a workaround and I'm not completely satisfied, but it works!

Thanks for the tips. You were of great help, even without knowing what I was really talking about.
