Text: Now I'm a bit confused, don't really get what you want, sorry :D Maybe you can post some code or another example, a bit more structured? If you just want to get the current page's parent, use `$page->parent()` and you get all the infos:

```php
$parent = $page->parent();
echo $parent->title(); // displays the parent's title â€“ just use it like another $page object
```
