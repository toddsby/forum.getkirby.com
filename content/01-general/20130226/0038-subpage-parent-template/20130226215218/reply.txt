Text: @russbaldwin yes, thank you, that is the tutorial I took a look at before starting, and it works great, except for that one thing.

@plartz *mind is blown*, yes that is the solution! All subpages that I renamed inside their folder now look the same as their parent, except for the blog articles. 

It works great for all subpages that have the same template structure as their parent. However, blogarticle.php has a different structure than blog.php, so when I rename blogarticle.txt to blog.txt, the template structure isn't correct anymore. (I know I can edit the blog.php template, but that doesn't produce what I need.)

Essentially, for the blog articles, I only need the parent CSS. Is that possible?

**Edit**
Okay, that thing about just needing the parent CSS is not true. I do need the parent template for articles, because that's the only way my active link color will show. I'm using this instead of page titles, and when I add the page title, text and date to blog.php for articles, /blog shows its page title, too. I just need 'Blog' in the menu to have an active link color on blog article pages.

I'm starting to think it's impossible, but I'm not as savvy with PHP as others, so there could be a solution after all.

**Yes, another edit**
I know it's possible in Wordpress with .current_page_parent, but can Kirby do it?
