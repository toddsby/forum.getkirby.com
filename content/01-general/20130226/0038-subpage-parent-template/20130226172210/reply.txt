Text: I think @zinzygeene's problem is how to access to the parent's css. 

If it's always the parent's css, and not the grandparent's, great-grandparent's ..., then you could just use the `parent()` function in your header. Combined with @russbaldwin's suggestion, your code could look like this:

```php
<?php 
  
  echo css('assets/styles/styles.css');
  
  $cssURI  = 'assets/css/' . $page->parent()->template() . '.css';
  $cssRoot = c::get('root') . '/' . $cssURI;
  
  if(file_exists($cssRoot)) echo css($cssURI);
  
?>
```


**Edit:** Okay, maybe I missunderstood you. You want only the template, not the css, right? Then just name your content text file (or markdown, or whatever) like the parent's one (quick example: parent's template is "project", so your children's content files might be named "project.txt").
