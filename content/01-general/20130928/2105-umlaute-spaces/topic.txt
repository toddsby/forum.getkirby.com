Text: Hi,
I've a question regarding german umlauts and spaces in tags or fields.

Is there a way to make them work?
I mean the problem is when I use spaces in tags e.g.: 

Tags: this is a test

This tag can be display'd but not filtered in other words the url in my case will be converted to:

http://localhost/kirby/tag;this+is+a+test

Which will of course have a destination of a plain white page (that tag does not exist at all)

The same problem exists for me with umlauts if I use them in tags they will not find the article...

regards,
Marc
