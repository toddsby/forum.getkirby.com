Text: I know this will be fairly simple but i cant seem to figure this out.

If i have a homepage similar to the following website: www.sortedmedia.co.uk

I want to create something similar to what they have with the Print, Advertising, Distribution categories with the sub pages listed below.

Ive tried using the foreach loop tutorial but still unable to figure this out.

Cheers
