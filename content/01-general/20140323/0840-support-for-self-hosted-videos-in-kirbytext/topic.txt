Text: I'd like to use a screen recording in one of my articles. Strangely I could only find how to embed video content hosted externally (vimeo/youtube) or within the template.

As the text formatting 101 lists for images...

```
( image: myawesomepicture.jpg)
```

...and external videos..

```

( youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuc6rtWkrM)

or 

( vimeo: http://vimeo.com/3432886)
```

... why can't I have something like this?

```
(video: myawesomevideo.mp4)
```

and save that video file in the same folder as my article.txt? 

WordPress has the [Video Shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Video_Shortcode) that allows you to even specify multiple sources or just paste the URL to a video on the line and it will detect and convert it to the mediaelement.js powered player.

I know there is the [Video Snippet](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/snippets/video/video.php) out there. Did somebody implement it so we can use it inside Kirbytext?

Edit1: Found this video tag extension by
(twitter: Pgruneich) https://gist.github.com/philgruneich/8551473

Edit2: Ok the gist from Phil was not 100% sufficient to my needs. It displayed an error that class kirbytextExtended was already defined and I realized that I already have this [figure element extension](http://getkirby.com/forum/code-snippets/topic:233) running and I would have to merge both tags in one file. 
But hey, the figure element can be used for videos too and even works great with my template style, so instead I changed the figure tag script to integrate the video [snippet](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/video).

The result is this gist:

Edit3: I just noticed that I must have forked the figure extension a long time ago back when it didn't have thumbnail and alignment support.
