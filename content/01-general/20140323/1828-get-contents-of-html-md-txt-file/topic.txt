Text: I'm trying to figure out how to get the contents of a .html/.md/.txt file. For example:

/content
-->/project-a
-->-->project.txt
-->-->photo.jpg
-->-->additional-text.md

I would like to be able to do things like:
– put the embed code of a video in a .html file
– add individual blocks of text within a loop of all project images and order everything by date

At best I can only get the URL of the file, and at worst it makes Kirby really unhappy. I can't find anything on how to accomplish this. Help is greatly appreciated!
