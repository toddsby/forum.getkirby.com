Text: I wonder if the community has come up with a cheatsheet to explain Kirbytext & Markdown to clients… I'm talking about a print-sized PDF or a simple webpage, like this <http://scottboms.com/downloads/documentation/markdown_cheatsheet.pdf>, with Kirbytext stuff, too…

If you got nothing I'll start working on one.
