Text: Hi There,
I am using a basic structure of the following.  So far I am able to pull in title but having trouble with text and link.

When I use php echo html($font->text()) ?> it spits out both the text and the link from the file... when I only want the text.

I have also been unsuccessful in pulling the link alone.
 href="php echo html($font->link()) ?>">Buy

Title: MyTitle

Text: lorem ipsum ...

Link:  http:www.#

Any help is appreciated.
