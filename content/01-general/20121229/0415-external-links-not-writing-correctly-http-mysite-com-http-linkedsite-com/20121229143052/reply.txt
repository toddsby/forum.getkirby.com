Text: Thanks - it looks like it's stripping out the : from http://

Here's what I have in my article text file - 

<pre>
----
Link: http://www.yahoo.ie/

</pre>

Any my template has:


<pre>
(I've removed < and > so it formats!)

?php if($page->link()): ?
	a class="button primary out" href=" ?php echo url($page->link()) ? ">Visit site /a 
	<?php endif ?>
</pre>
Is there a better way of doing this?

Thanks
