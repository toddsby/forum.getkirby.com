Text: Hi guys, I've taken a look at the tag tutorial but can't figure it out. I've added a category field to my articles - so I plan to assign one of three to each post. 

The resulting text file looks like this:

*********************
Title: Super duper post

----

Role: Role goes here

----

Text: Text goes here

Link:

Category: 2

*********************

On my homepage I'd like normal links to work as filters for the categories (1, 2 or 3), is this possible?

Thanks,
J
