Text: Unless I'm missing something (entirely possible), this seems needlessly complex. I would do something more like this:

    <?php if ($article->files()->find('cover.jpg')) { ?>
        <img src="<?php echo $article->files()->find('cover.jpg')->url() ?>">
    <?php } ?>

Then you don't have to have a field with a filename, you just put a cover.jpg in the folder with the particular page content. Requires you to always use the same name, but that's OK (judging by your original post).

If you want to get really fancy and allow either a jpg or png to be allowed for a given page, you could do something using the newer filterBy options in (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/1-1-1 text: Kirby 1.1.1).

    <?php $coverimage = $article->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', 'cover') ?>
    <?php if ($coverimage)) { ?>
        <img src="<?php echo $coverimage->url() ?>">
    <?php } ?>

Something like that, anyway.
