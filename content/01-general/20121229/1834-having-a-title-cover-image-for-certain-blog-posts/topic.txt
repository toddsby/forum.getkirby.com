Text: on my home page I'm listing all articles, and if there's a images present it will display them beneath the title. 

I would like to change this so that if a particular type of image is present then it will display (eg: cover image/title image), and if that image isn't present (but there may be other images) then no image displays on the home.php. Is calling a particular file name the way to do this? Anyone any ideas as I'm a little stumped! :)

Thanks,
J
