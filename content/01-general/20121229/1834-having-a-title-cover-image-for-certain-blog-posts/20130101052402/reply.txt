Text: @fitzage You're correct and your method should work just fine too.

Although the method I described above requires a bit more upfront work, I choose to do it this way for a few reasons:

1. I usually don't like to hard code image names like that into templates, if I cam avoid it
2. I always find more value in descriptive file names rather than a bunch of `cover.jpg`'s
3. I think the select box, which lets you choose *any* of your uploaded images, is super quick and easy. If you had a blog post with 10 photos, the select box allows you to quickly pick and try-out those covers photos without renaming two files each time.

A lot of this mindset comes from building client sites, where if its just a simple select box, it's one less thing to teach, force and make sure it's done correctly. The select box has a title and can have help text, but they'd have to *remember* that naming an image `cover.jpg` is the trick to get what they want.

But each method has a time and a place.
