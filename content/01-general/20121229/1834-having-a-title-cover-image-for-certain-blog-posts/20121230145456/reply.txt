Text: I use it like that, if I find a specific image file I show it else I show the first of any other images or none at all if there are none. It seems to work OK.

Of course your don't have to do anything if you do not find the specified image, but it does mean you have to be consistent in your image naming e.g. 'cover.jpg'
