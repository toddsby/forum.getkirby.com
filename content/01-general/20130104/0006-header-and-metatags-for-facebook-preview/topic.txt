Text: Hi there,

could you please help me?

Whenever I post a link to a blogpost on Facebook, the preview always shows the same title/description/ from the homepage/indexpage. 

how do i have to i modify the header, that Facebook displays the post-title and post-description in the preview?

i tried custom metatags but i'm really a beginner with no code experience.

thanks for your help
ky
