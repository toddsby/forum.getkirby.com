Text: Thanks, Russell.

You are a genius and a gentleman.

Every time I set the rewrite rule in config.php I got a 404, apart from on the home (blog) page.

When I replaced the content of my htaccess file with the documented version linked to in your message everything started working.

I copied my original htaccess info from somewhere else on the forum. It was probably not intended for the set-up I am using.

Thanks again.
