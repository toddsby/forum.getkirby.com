Text: It looks like you either do not have the friendly URL's enabled either in your sites' config.php

        c::set('rewrite', true);

Or in your [.htaccess (as per the documentation)](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/blob/master/.htaccess) is not configured correctly.

I maybe you do not have the rights to use or alter your .htaccess file because your host does not allow it, in which you maybe stuck with what you have.
