Text: I am assuming the problems I am having stem from my htaccess and config settings. The content of both files can be found here: https://gist.github.com/4451481

Note that I removed the licence key.

## The problem

I want my home page to be my blog page (this seems fine), but I want the URLs to resolve to:

    domain.com/article-name

Currently, I am getting:

    domain.com/index.php/blog/article-name

The site is up and running at wordius.com if that helps you visualise the problem better.

Any help appreciated. I know as much about htaccess as I do about the anatomy of Australian tree frogs, which is to say not a lot.
