Text: You get the same problem using Markdown’s standard image syntax:

    ![Image](http://image.png)

While my paragraphs don’t have a bottom margin, I still encounter problems because I apply a text-indent to subsequent paragraphs:

    p + p {
        text-indent: 2em;
    }

I’ve reverted to calling images using the ‘img’ tag and wrapping them in a ‘div’ with a clear line space inserted above and below the ‘div’. Markdown does not appear to recognise ‘section’ as a block-level element, which creates other problems.
