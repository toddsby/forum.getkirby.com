Text: Tried the suggested code, but it doesn’t appear to work. All items appear in a single line, rather than structured between url tags, like:

    <url>
        Item one
    </url>
    <url>
        Item two
    </url>

Adding drafts to ignore doesn’t get rid of the child directory containing my blog template. So, I removed the child directory, which seemed to be the simplest solution.
