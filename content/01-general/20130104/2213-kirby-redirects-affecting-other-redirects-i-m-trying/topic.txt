Text: So normally I would do something like this to make www.joyent.com redirect to joyent.com:

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.joyent.com$
    RewriteRule (.*) http://joyent.com/$1 [R=Permanent]

However, apparently the standard Kirby redirects are affecting this, because I end up with everything redirecting to joyent.com/index.php instead of joyent.com/whatever/the/url-is/

Any idea on how to modify this to fix that?
