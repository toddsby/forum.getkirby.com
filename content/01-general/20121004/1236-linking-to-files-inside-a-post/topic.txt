Text: I've had a search through the docs and forum about this, but couldn't find what I needed, so my apologies if this is an obvious question:

I know I can link to files (e.g. images) inside an article/page folder with the template fields. This works for galleries where you're doing a loop to just bring in all the images in the folder and using the template to hook it in using Kirby's variables.

My question is what the best way to link to files, such as a PDF, is in the body of the post (e.g. with Markdown)? I'd like my structure to be

-- 09-my-article-folder
----- article.txt
----- somefile.pdf

I can't simply write in my Markdown a local link to "somefile.pdf" because it doesn't pick up the correct base URL. And even using a URL like "./my-article-folder/somefile.pdf" doesn't work because "my-article-folder" is not a real file path URL (because the real directory is 09-my-article-folder).

At the moment, I solved this by having a downloads folder in the top level of the content folder and linking with "../content/downloads/somefile.pdf" in the Markdown of the post but it would be nicer to have the files associated with the article in the article's folder.

Am I being stupid here or does someone have a suggestion?
