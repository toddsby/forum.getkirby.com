Text: All sets of files in Kirby have a method called slice(). You can use that to get all images except the first one like this: 

```
<?php foreach($page->images()->slice(1) as $img) ?>
<!-- do something with the other images -->
<?php endforeach ?>
```

slice always starts with 0 as index for the first image. That's why you need to set slice(1) to get all images except the first one. In fact slice() is the equivalent to PHP's array_slice, so you can check out PHP's docs for more options: <http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-slice.php>

If you know the name of the first image – for example cover.jpg – you could also do 

```
<?php foreach($page->images()->not('cover.jpg') as $img) ?>
<!-- do something with the other images -->
<?php endforeach ?>
```

I hope this helps.
