Text: While creating a site built on Kirby, I wanted the images in my articles to have the following attributes:

- Wrapped in a proper figure tag
- The image inside the figure should be a thumbnail of the original
- The thumbnail inside the figure should link to the full, original size of the image
- Option to have a figure caption
- Option to add a class for alignment (via CSS), e.g. alignleft, or alignright



So I extended Kirbytext with a custom figure tag. You can use it like this:

    (figure: photo.jpg)

or

    (figure: photo.jpg caption: What a great photo! align: left)
