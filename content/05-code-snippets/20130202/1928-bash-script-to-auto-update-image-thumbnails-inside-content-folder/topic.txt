Text: It's not exactly a "code snippet", but I thought some of you could find it useful. 

Kirby (core CMS) does not resize images and the docs suggest to upload thumbs in the same folder:
http://getkirby.com/docs/media 
01.jpg
01.thumb.jpg 
...

One solution is Thumb plugin - http://getkirby.com/blog/thumb-plugin - which needs **/thumbs** folder for cached resized images.

If you prefer to keep thumbs in the same folder as originals, and have ImageMagick installed on your server, another solution is the following bash script:

	#!/bin/bash

	## settings
	fit=480

	## do not edit below
	for f in $(find . -iname '*.jpg' -a ! -iname '*.thumb.jpg'); do
		t=${f/.jpg/.thumb.jpg}
		if [ -f "${f}" ]; then
			convert ${f} -adaptive-resize ${fit}x${fit} ${t}
		fi;
		echo ${t}; 
	done;


Save it as something like "update.sh" in root folder, and run from Terminal.
