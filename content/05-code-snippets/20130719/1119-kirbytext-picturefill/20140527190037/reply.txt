Text: That looks really interesting! I hadn't thought about adding this into KirbyText. I did however find a need for a picture() style tag to the template so I put together a plugin based on thumb which handles resizing images.

Just starting out on a project where I will be using it, but check it out on Github be great to get some feedback on it
