Text: After &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt; in the htaccess file add this:

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/panel/
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /+[^\.]+$
    RewriteRule ^(.+[^/])$ %{REQUEST_URI}/ [R=301,L]

**Exclude Kirby Panel**

The first row excludes /panel/. It does not force trailing slash to Kirby Panel.

**Redirect trailing slash**

The second and third row will redirect all the other urls to a trailing slash.

**This...**

    http://my-kirby-site.com/about

**...will become this...**

    http://my-kirby-site.com/about/

It will work both on server and on a localhost environment.
