Text: After &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt; in the htaccess file add this:

    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]

It redirects a domain to www like this:

**This...**

    http://my-kirby-site.com/about

**will become this...**

    http://www.my-kirby-site.com/about

I would NOT recommend this for the htaccess on a localhost environment.
