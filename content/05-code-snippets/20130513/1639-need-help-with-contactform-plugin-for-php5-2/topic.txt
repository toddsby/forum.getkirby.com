Text: Hi forum,

I was wondering if anybody has succesfully used the contactform plugin on PHP5.2 ? I know it was written for 5.3, and I would rewrite it if I could but I have no idea where to start.

So if there's anybody out there who has rewritten it, I would really like to know.

Thanks so much,
