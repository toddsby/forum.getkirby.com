I want to send a variable to a snippet, but I want the snippet to function without this variable. The variable will be a URL path for the logo of my page. Is there a way to set a "else" for the URL? I tried a couple things and I am not quite figuring it out.

    <?php 
    $logourl = 'assets/images/logo-inverse.png';
    $logo = $logourl;
    if ($logotype == false) {
     $logourl = 'assets/images/logo.png'; 
    } else 
     $logourl = 'assets/images/logo-inverse.png';
    ?>

    <img src="<?php echo url($logourl) ?>" class="logo visible-md visible-lg visible-xs" height="22px" alt="<?php echo html($site->title()) ?>" />
