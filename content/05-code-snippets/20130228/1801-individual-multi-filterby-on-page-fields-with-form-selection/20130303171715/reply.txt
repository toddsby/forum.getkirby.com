Text: Hello all,

I'm using the multifilterby from Russ, and I would like to integrate an extra option value field.

It's not a standard one, which queries the tagcloud, it's something like this:

<//select>
<//option>Upcoming events</option>
<//option>This month</option>
<//option>Next month</option>
<//option>Past events</option>
<///select>

How would I have to integrate this with, for example the upcoming events


 //php $postDate = strtotime($article->enddate());
			//$todaysDate = time() - (time() % 86400);
				//if ( $postDate >= $todaysDate) : //?>
