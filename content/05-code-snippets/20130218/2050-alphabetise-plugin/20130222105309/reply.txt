Thanks to Paul who pointed out a few issues with sorting and titles with spaces in, (due to me exploding the string on a space.)
Mmmm...
Now using a tilde '~' so unless you have a tilde in your 'alphabetic' key title/string, then you should be OK.

Let me know if you have further problems via GitHub, thanks again Paul for spotting these.
