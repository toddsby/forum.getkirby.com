Text: Thanks @StartidiMotori, I did forget to mention the other change was to the calling code for pages. So for pages we added a pre-sort by adding 
```php 
->sortby('title') 
``` 
to the array e.g.

```php
<?php $alphabetise = alphabetise($page->children()->visible()->sortby('title'), array('key' => 'title')); 
```

The tag example already has sorting in the calling so there was no need to change that.
