Text: Hi there!

I am trying to figure out how to correctly embed the Typekit script into my header snippet. I am a newbie to PHP, but I have been enjoying the learning process while using Kirby (which I love so far).

This is the Typekit script:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="//use.typekit.net/zqf7rux.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript"> try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}</script>`

Would I do something like this?

`<?php echo js('//use.typekit.net/zqf7rux.js') ?>
<?php echo js('try{Typekit.load();}catch(e){}') ?>`

I am not so sure about the second line. If anyone has any advice or tips about an alternative way to do this, I would be very grateful!

Thanks in advance!
