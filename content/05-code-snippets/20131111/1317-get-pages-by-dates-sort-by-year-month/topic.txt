Function which returns an array of Kirby page objects, or nested arrays when grouping by year or month.

I wrote this function for my templating needs because just using `$pages->sortBy('date','desc')` would return pages with no date metadata, and I wanted to exclude those. Also I needed to write separate lists of posts for each calendar year, so I included that and more in the feature set.

Some nice things it does:

- group by year or year then month;
- by default, donâ€™t return pages with a date in the future (which kinda enables you to post articles or other content to your site and have them become visible at the given date);
- give date boundaries, and offset/limit settings, for whatever advanced use you may need.
