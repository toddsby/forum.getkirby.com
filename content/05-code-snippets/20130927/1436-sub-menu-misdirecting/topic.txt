Text: I've got a headache from looking at this, I have a menu (using bootstrap etc) for my pages, it has a dropdown, in that dropdown you have the children pages showing up. This uses code from the various examples of nested menu's that bastian posted. My problem is that when you are on a child page and use the menu, the link to the parent page is incorrect. Example, you click on support > financial, then when on financial you click support, you get set to support/support

I'm not sure what i've done incorrectly, my code is becoming a bit of an unreadible mess, but thats a different issue of learning some best practices.

Here is a gist of my code:
