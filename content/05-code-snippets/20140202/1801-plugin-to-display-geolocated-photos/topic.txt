Text: I made a plugin that makes it easy to include a Panoramio photo gallery in your templates.

Panoramio is a photo-sharing site where you're encouraged to geolocate your photos. They end up on Google Earth and Google Maps. I use it for my travel photography, so this plugin helps pull that content back into my Kirby-powered site.

Even if you don't use Panoramio yourself, you could use it to display, say, the 10 most popular photos taken in Paris, France.
