Text: I used the "How to add template-specific CSS files" post to add custom CSS, but now I am trying to post custom JS from a folder, and I can't seem to make that work now. My code:

    <?php
  
    $jsURI  = 'assets/js/custom' . $page->template() . '.js';
    $jsRoot = c::get('root') . '/' . $jsURI;
  
    if(file_exists($jsRoot)) echo js($jsURI);
  
    ?>

please help! Thank you
