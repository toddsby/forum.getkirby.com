Text: Instead of Gist, you can use (link: http://codepen.io text: Codepen) to show off your code experiments, even the result, this is great service.

With this new tag you can easily insert the embeded Codepen, quickly like this :

```
(codepen: http://codepen.io/CBeghin/pen/HeuiF height: 100 type: result)
```

Check out my gist here: (link: https://gist.github.com/ClementRoy/5024929) and read the readme!
