Text: I want to use AWS with Kirby if it's possible but I need lots of help.

I have a serious learning curve ahead of me with this, never coded with php but sick of the bloat of WYSIWYG and hosted solutions etc. You know the score.

I have my new company domains registered, I'm signed up for AWS... **but I can't even find out if it's possible!**

Anybody with any help or pointers? Better still, anyone done it?

Greatly appreciated.

R!
