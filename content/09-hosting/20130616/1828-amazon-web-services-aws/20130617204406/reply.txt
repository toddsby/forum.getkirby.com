Text: Thanks Roman,

I feel really out of my depth. Anyway, currently thinking about doing it on EC2 with Elastic IP - either that or using something like the cloud hosting with http://bitnami.com/cloud - they don't have a one-click installer but Erica (the COO) says I can SSH it in.

The website I'm planning to build will be super-simple anyway so I feel like this is overkill but at least I will learn.

Thanks,

Rodney
