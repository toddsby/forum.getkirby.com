Text: In your virtual host config file (should be located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available`), make sure you have something like this in your root.

    <Directory /home/root/>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
      AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

When you change it, be sure to restart Apache with `service apache2 restart`.
