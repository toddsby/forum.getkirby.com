Text: Could someone write up a small how-to on getting Kirby running on Pagoda Box? I tried, however I keep encountering the error "Fatal error: Call to a member function isErrorPage() on a non-object in /var/www/kirby/lib/site.php on line 97". I know it probably has something to do with the way my config or Boxfile is. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
