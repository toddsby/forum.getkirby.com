Text: I'm setup on a VPS (not managed) using Kirby. I have had zero issues regarding my VPS so far and the IRC channel has been a lot of help if you're new to the command line like myself.


 My live Kirby setup is installed inside my Dropbox folder. Everything works flawlessly. I'm really enjoying editing all within a Dropbox environment using Markdown and not having to worry about my website since it syncs to my server and also works as a backup system.
