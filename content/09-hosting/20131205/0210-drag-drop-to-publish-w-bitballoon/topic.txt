Text: Hey guys, 

I highly recommend you host your sites on BitBalloon, it's literally tailor made to host Kirby sites. Instead of FTP, you just drag & drop   your site folder onto BitBalloon.com and its live in seconds.

Beyond the one-step publishing, BitBalloon also optimizes your code and images for performance and will "automagically" make any web forms in your site work, complete with a submissions database and email notifications!

If drag & drop doesn't fit with your workflow, there's also an API and command line interface, so you can just do 'gem install bitballoon' and publish from the terminal with 'bitballoon deploy'

You can try it our for free, even without creating account. And at $5/month, I think you'll find that it pretty much blows your other options like shared hosting or a VPS out of the water in terms of price/performance/usability.

I'm a co-founder at BitBalloon and the team here would really love to hear about your experience if you do deploy your Kirby site to Bitballoon!

You can reach us through the Olark chat in the bottom right of [https://www.bitballoon.com](https://www.bitballoon.com)
