Text: I've been with StableHost for more than a year, and I can vouch for them, at least in the case of shared hosting. They're pretty cheap (they almost always have an ongoing 30%-off coupon promotion). Moreover, their service is great: they respond to support tickets very quickly and their explanations are clear and helpful. Since they use cPanel, I manage my domain with them as well, including DNS management and email forwarders.
