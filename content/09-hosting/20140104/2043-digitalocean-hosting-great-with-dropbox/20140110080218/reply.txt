Text: And their support is just great! Most of the times I get an answer within 5 minutes. And not a standard reply, but something a real person typed.

Paying per hour instead of a full month is also great. Unlimited snapshots you can use for a new VPS too is just awesome!
The only thing they need to get fixed asap is backups, but I'm sure they will soon. Until then I just make them myself.

Just use the (link: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=e675af2179ff text: referral link) above (I just repeat it here, it's not mine!) and start enjoying the cheapest AND best VPS provider!
