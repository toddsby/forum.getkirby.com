Text: I have two low-volume Kirby sites running on one Joyent server with good performance and no issues. Joyent.com is pretty high traffic, and is running on Kirby as well using a load balanced setup between two servers with a Stingray load balancer in front. Performance is good.

Joyent isn't exactly budget hosting, so it's probably more server than most of you guys need. We do now have an extra small option that is only $21.90/month, and is still a high performance virtual dedicated server that should be able to handle a fairly high amount of traffic if you ever need to go beyond the shared hosting that most of you currently use.
