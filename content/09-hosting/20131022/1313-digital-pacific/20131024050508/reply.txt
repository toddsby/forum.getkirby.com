The issue appears to be with the function declaration in " /home/thomasgr/public_html/dptest/kirby/lib/kirby.php". I read in Kirby support forums that the MySQL database support is not required for Kirby CMS. However, when I checked the file " /home/thomasgr/public_html/kirby/kirby/lib/kirby.php", I noticed a database connection definition section :

======

static function connect() {

$connection = self::connection();
$args = func_get_args();
$host = a::get($args, 0, c::get('db.host', 'localhost'));
$user = a::get($args, 1, c::get('db.user', 'root'));
$password = a::get($args, 2, c::get('db.password'));
$database = a::get($args, 3, c::get('db.name'));

======

The error occurs when the function "get()" is declared more than once in a file. Unfortunately, the issue is out side of our support boundaries. Please consult with a developer or contact Kirby developers (http://getkirby.com/contact) so as to fix the issue.
