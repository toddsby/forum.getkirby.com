Text: I can't really see a reason why it should not run. You do have the stable version not the alpha/beta?

Can you post .htaccess and config.php, removing any sensitive bits.
Also some idea of your folder layout from root can help.

I also can't see your PHP info, indeed you seem to have some sort of site running?
