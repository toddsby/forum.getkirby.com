Text: Hello,

I have a site that was coded using Kirby (http://lainlee3design.com).  I have two new pages that I'd like to add using the same functionality as the Portfolio, with the exception of one page that will have more of a "Kickstarter" or Betabrand crowdfunding functionality (ex. http://www.betabrand.com/think-tank/crowdfunding/mens-gray-cotton-chinos-pants.html).

If you're available to help out, please contact me at lain3@lainlee3design.com.  Am looking to do a trade for work with an experienced developer/coder I can develop an ongoing working relationship with! I'm a designer/illustrator experienced in graphic and web design.  

I look forward to hearing from you!

Thanks,
Lain 3
