Text: I can add ._ to the content ignore list which is great but we also have problems when editing the plugins we are trying develop. Anytime a mac user edits the files the page shows:

Mac OS X 	2ï¿½ï¿½ATTR$oï¿½ï¿½#ï¿½#com.macromates.caret{ column = 33; line = 38; }This resource fork intentionally left blank ï¿½ï¿½

Could you ignore the ._ files when reading the plugins too?
