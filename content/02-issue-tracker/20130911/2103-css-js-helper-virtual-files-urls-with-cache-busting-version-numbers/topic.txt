Text: To make CSS and JS files cache-friendly (ie. adding long expires headers), I need to add version strings in the URL to bust the HTTP cache. So e.g. 

http://example.com/assets/css/styles.css

should be called like so:

http://example.com/assets/css/styles.123.css

When I use the css()-helper function (css("assets/css/styles.123.css")), this does not work, as css() uses the url()-function, which tries to be a bit too clever and checks if a file exists to not build it as a normal kirby-URL (btw. I have multi-language support enabled). That way, my cache busting URL outputs like so:

http://example.com/de/assets/css/styles.123.css

This of course generates 404.


The easy fix is to write the link/script tags as HTML myself, but I like the helpers. :)
