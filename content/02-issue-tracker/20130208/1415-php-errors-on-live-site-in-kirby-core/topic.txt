Text: After having placed the site in my client's hosting account, I get errors that I did not get when testing on another hosting server. The site I just uploaded is an exact copy of the error-free one, except the license number and the site URL.

The error I get:
Uninitialized string offset: 0 in /var/www/vhosts/zowel.eu/httpdocs/kirby/lib/variables.php on line 27

Apart from that, the site works.

After logging into the panel, I get this:
Notice: Uninitialized string offset: 0 in /var/www/vhosts/zowel.eu/httpdocs/kirby/lib/variables.php on line 27
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /var/www/vhosts/zowel.eu/httpdocs/kirby/lib/variables.php:27) in /var/www/vhosts/zowel.eu/httpdocs/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 47

That's Kirby core, so I did not touch that.

URL of the error-free site: www.simpelcms.nu
URL of the error-throwing site: www.zowel.eu

Any ideas anyone?
