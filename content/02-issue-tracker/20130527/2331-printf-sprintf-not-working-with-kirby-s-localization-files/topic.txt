Text: If we consider that I added this line to the en.php language file:
`'form.error-max' => 'Maximum characters exceeded (maximum is %d) !'`

I can't seem to get the %d to change to an integer (or even %s to a string) by using the following:
`<?php printf(l::get('form.email-val'), 100); ?`

Anyone experienced this?

I'd prefer not doing a hack around this problem. I do think it has to do with single quotes, even though I tried replacing them like:
`"form.error-max" => "Maximum characters exceeded (maximum is %d) !"`

Any solution is welcomed. Thanks.
