Text: Kirby can only handle 2-digit sorting.
Folders not following that structure are not "public", so you can call them directly over HTTP, but they won't appear in navigations.

This is actually fixable, I can create a pull request when I'm back home. :)

But: Why the hell do you have more than 99 subfolders? A big blog?
If not, maybe rethink your folder layout and split them up by category or something like that - for example when creating documentation or something like that :).
