Text: @russbaldwin you are right. the z-index for the logout link is totally arbitrary and I can't tell why I set it that way to be honest :) It must have been late or something :) I just fixed it for the mobile and the regular version and it doesn't overlap the fancybox anymore. I'm not responsible for the z-indexes in the fancybox scripts btw. They are taken as is from the original fancybox version. 

You can get the updated version from the dev branch:
