Text: Mmmm, you've added z-index but this causes problems when you view an image in Panel as the 'Logout' button shows through the FancyBox overlay.

In *screen.css*

    .logout {
    ...
    z-index: 111111;

and in *screen.mobile.css*

	.logout {
	....
	z-index: 2999;  

Anyway setting the z-index to 1 in both solves the problem for me YMMV. 
All the z-indexes seem a bit strange/arbitary including those in *fancybox.css* ?
