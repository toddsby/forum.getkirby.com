Text: I have this in my txt:

<pre>Cabecera:
Biografía
</pre>
and i try to insert in the template with:

<pre>?php echo html($page->cabecera()) ?
</pre>
i get an empty string, i think im having problem with the accented í.

removing it solves the problem.

is there some workaroung to fix this?

thanks.

PD: i tryed with <pre>+?php echo kirbytext($page->cabecera(), false) ?+</pre> 
It works but i dont know if this is safe.
