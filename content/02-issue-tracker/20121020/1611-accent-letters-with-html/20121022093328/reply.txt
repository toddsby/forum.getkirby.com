Text: This works for me with accented characters (I was using a 'text' field)

	<?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>

Not sure if this is relevant but I have UTF-8 forced in my Apache settings in .htaccess

    # Use UTF-8 encoding for anything served text/plain or text/html
    AddDefaultCharset utf-8

    # Force UTF-8 for a number of file formats
    AddCharset utf-8 .atom .css .js .json .rss .vtt .xml
