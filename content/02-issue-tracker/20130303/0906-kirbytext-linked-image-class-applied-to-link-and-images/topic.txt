Text: If you specify a linked image with KirbyText with a class, the class is applied to the link and the image. This has proved problematic with things like FancyBox and whilst you can get around it, there surely should be a better way of handling this, perhaps separate classes for link and image?

In the best of both worlds KirbyText should allow for two classes, one for the image and one for the link. It currently only takes the last one you set if I do something like this:

```
( image: img.jpg  class: myImgClass  alt:AltText link: http://me.com  class: myLinkClass )
```

```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myLinkClass" 
title="img"  alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```

When what you would like would be something like:
```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myImgClass" 
title="img" alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```
