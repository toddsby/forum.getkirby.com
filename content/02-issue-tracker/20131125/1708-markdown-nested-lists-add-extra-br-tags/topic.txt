Text: I have an issue where Kirby/Markdown adds extra unwanted </br> tags into my nested lists. The issue can be seem in the first nested list on [this page](http://blog.alexanderkucera.com/blog/assembling_a_vfx_camera_kit).

The actual Markdown file is formatted like this:

    The goal is to build a kit that works well in four different situations:
    
    * Professional:  
    	* Set photography (making reference photos, shooting textures, making set HDRis, etc.)
    	* Panorama photography (HDRi and normal panoramas)
    * Personal:  
    	* Since I am a rather new dad (boy, 10 months) I will use the camera for child photography. He is already a speedy little guy and I only see this getting more intense as time moves on.
    	* Also, we own three ferrets who are even speedier.
    

Any ideas?
