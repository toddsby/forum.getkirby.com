Text: Well, the title says everything. Maybe this is one for the panel and for Bastian, but nevertheless â€“ maybe some of you have experienced that before? Well, I tried so much different variations of escaping, but the panel always removes them, so after saving the backslashes aren't there anymore. For example in this case:
```
1. Nice subhead

Lorem ipsum, you know that. Long paragraph here.

2. Another nice subhead

Another longgggg text here.
```
Of course I don't want this whole text in a ol-list, so I tried to escape the "headings" with the backslash before the number, before the dot, before both... everytime the backslash is away. Manually opening the textfile and saving works, but I (well, especially the client) need it also in the panel to work. Anybody knows a solution for that?
