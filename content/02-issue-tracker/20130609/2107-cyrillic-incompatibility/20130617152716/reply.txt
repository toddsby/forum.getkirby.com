OK, the tags problem is not a big deal as I renamed all my tags to latin. It works that way.

But the search fails. Search the 'дизайн' term returns nothing, although you can clearly see the word in the heading here http://vladislav.tv/articles/apple-design/ (the third word in the sentence). (I know it's all in Russian, but since the problem is all about cyrillic, I can't provide example more suitable for you, sorry.)
