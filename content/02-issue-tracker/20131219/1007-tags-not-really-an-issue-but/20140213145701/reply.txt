Text: Hi Jed,
it does work for me. The *active* class is assigned to multi-word tags when I click on them.
I had this issue with my blog page and it seems ok now.
I also had to slightly change the way in which posts are filtered using tags:

from:
<code>
<? foreach($pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->filterBy('tags', param('tag'), ',')->limit(10)->flip() as $p) : ?>
</code>

to:
<code>
<? foreach($pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->filterBy('tags', urldecode(param('tag')), ',')->limit(10)->flip() as $p) : ?>
</code>

Hope this helps.
Pierpaolo
