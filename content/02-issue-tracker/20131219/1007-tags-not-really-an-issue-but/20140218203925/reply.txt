Text: This is working for me. Thank you for tracking this down!

Also, although the change suggested above makes everything work just fine, I found that the multi-word tag URL’s produced by the tagcloud plugin had spaces in them. So a normal tag might be `/blog/tag:testing`, but a multi-word tag would be `/blog/tag:test test`. Upon following that URL, the browser would encode the space to ‘%20’, which is different from Kirby’s built-in encoding (it replaces spaces with ‘+’). This means two separate URL’s could be linking to the same page, which could cause some analytics and SEO issues. But for me, I’m just OCD so I don’t want multiple URL’s everywhere.

To fix this, also change line 48 in `tagcloud.php` from this:

```php
'url'      => $options['baseurl'] . '/' . $options['param'] . $ds . $t,
```

…to this:

```php
'url'      => $options['baseurl'] . '/' . $options['param'] . $ds . urlencode($t),
```
