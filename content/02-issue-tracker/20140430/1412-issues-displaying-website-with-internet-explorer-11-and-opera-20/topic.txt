Text: Hello,

I tried opening a site with IE11 that I'm actually building with Kirby and the slacky theme. Turns out that it displays the site totally wrong. In Opera, Chrome & Firefox it's working (only a little mistake regarding the fonts in Opera). Opera & Chrome share the same engine but somehow it's working perfectly in Chrome.

Tried to google the IE-issue and looked into this forum but haven't found a solution to the problem yet.

I made some screenshots of it:

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?


Kind regards and many thanks in advance,

Steffen
