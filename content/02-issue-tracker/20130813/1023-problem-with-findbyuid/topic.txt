Text: Hello,

I'm working on a multilanguage website.
Pages don't have the same Title in the different languages so I can't use the find() fonction to get a page.
So because of this problem I use the findByUID() fonction but this fonction is not very nice to use:
I tried to get a page with for example $page1=$pages->findByUID('page1') and when I do  $page1->title() it doesn't work. When I try to do $page1->count() it returns 1. If I try with  foreach($page1 as $apage1){ $apage1->url(); } it works.

Why?

Thank you.
