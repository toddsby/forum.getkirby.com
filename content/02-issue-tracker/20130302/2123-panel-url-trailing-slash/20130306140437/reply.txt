Text: I presume that your folder structure is:
```
root
-www
--mysite.com
---test <- Kirby CMS
```

In my case I use Kirby .htaccess with (link:https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.htaccess text:HTML5 Boilerplate), but standard Kirby htaccess might work well too.

In your case `~site/config/config.php` just use:
```php
c::set('url', 'http://www.mysite.com/test');
```

My preferred method is using a subdomain:
```php
c::set('url', 'http://www.test.mysite.com/');
```

This should works for both.
