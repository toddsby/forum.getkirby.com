Text: Ok so these are the settings I have:

.htaccess 
      RewriteBase /test/site

site/config/config.php
      c::set('url', 'http://www.mysite.com/test/site');
      c::set('subfolder', 'test/site');
      
I don't think anything else could be of influence? Like I said, I used the default htaccess file from the Kirby download.

Thanks again for any help!
