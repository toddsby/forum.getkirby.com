Text: The code is not quite right, but also you should check if your *$workshop->category()* is it actually a string, I've added *strval* below, just in case ;-)

Try this, not tested:

```php 
<?php if(strval($workshop->category()) =='studio') echo "studio" ?>
```

If you are sure it is a string then this would suffice:

```php 
<?php if($workshop->category() =='studio') echo "studio" ?>
```
