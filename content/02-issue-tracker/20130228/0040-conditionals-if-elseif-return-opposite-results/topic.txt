Text: Hello,

I'm not sure if this is a bug (might be) or if it's something I'm doing wrong or setup wrong. My conditionals work but return opposite results. For example this,

        <?php if($workshop->category() == 'studio'): ?>
        <?php echo 'studio' ?>

should return 'studio' when category is set to 'studio'. But it doesn't. Only when I use != instead of == does it return the desired result.

Any ideas? Thanks.
