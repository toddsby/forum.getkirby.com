Text: I did a fresh install of Kirby on my server with the demo site on it.

Every time I click on a link (About, Projects) following page shows up:

> The requested document was not found on this server.
>
> Apache Server at domain.com Port 80


It only works if I paste following code in the .htaccess:

>RewriteEngine on
>RewriteRule !.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css|php)$ index.php
>php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
>php_flag register_globals off


Is there a reason that I need it because like I see everyone else did not needed this code?
