Text: I've set up a Kirby dev site at work on mamp and everything works just fine.

When I do the same or copy the site to my home wamp I encounter the following:

Previous / Next links on mac:
http://localhost/blog/page:2 (see :)

Previous / Next links on win turn into:
http://localhost/blogo/page;2 (see ; )

Both work.

For the tag cloud on mac:
http://localhost/blog/blog/tag:php

On win:
http://localhost/blog/blog/tag:php

The tag links on win don't work but they do when I manually change : to ;

I'm lost about how and why, any of you guys or girls got an idea?

Thanks and Happy New Year all and especially Bastian with the new born.
