Text: I know it's more a Kirby ToolKit things, but still the KirbyCMS core. Try it on many devices, many ways.. it returns nothing.. no false, no error, just nothing.

Edit : It seems that the ::mobile refers to old device (no android or something similar are supported) If you need to fixed it temporary, use (link:http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ text:detectmobilebrowsers.com) as a Kirby plugin to get some mobile devices detection.
