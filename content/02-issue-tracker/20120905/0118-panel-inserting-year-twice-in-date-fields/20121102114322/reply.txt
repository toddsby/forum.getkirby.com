Text: Ok, that's easy to fix :) 

First, I just got the format in the docs wrong for the date field. If you want to have a full year it's really just yy instead of yyyy

Then you are using mm.dd.yy which PHP isn't able to parse. You would need something like yy-mm-dd or mm/dd/yy or dd.mm.yy. 

As soon as PHP is able to parse the entered date, it will also show the correct date in the template when you use date formatting.
