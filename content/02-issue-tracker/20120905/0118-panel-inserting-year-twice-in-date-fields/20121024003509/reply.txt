Text: I'm having similar issues with dates too. My goal is for the dates on my articles to be formatted like this: **October 23, 2012**.

Let me try to break down each scenario and the changes I made in the files:

### Scenario 1

**Blueprint**
    label: Date
    type: date
    format: mm.dd.yyyy

**Panel Shows**
    10.23.20122012

**Template**
    $page->date('F j, Y')

**Rendered Page**
    January 1, 1970


### Scenario 2

**Blueprint**
    label: Date
    type: date
    format: mm.dd.yy

**Panel Shows**
    10.23.2012

**Template**
    $page->date('F j, Y')

**Rendered Page**
    January 1, 1970


So I'm super lost why the page is rendering January 1, 1970 and why the panel is putting the year twice.


_Thanks in advance for any help!_
