Text: I'm currently testing Kirby out, and I think I found an issue. My current setup is this:

```
<div><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></div>
<div><?php echo html($page->date()) ?></div>
<div><?php echo html($page->location()) ?></div>
<div><?php echo multiline($page->address()) ?></div>
<div><?php echo html($page->coaches()) ?></div>
<div><?php echo html($page->description()) ?></div>
```

For some reason 'date' does not want to display. When I rename it, it works. It seems that Kirby just doesn't like the name 'Date'.

Here's how my text file is setup:

```
  Title:
  Title test
  ----
  Date:
  jeudi, mai 1, 2014 to dimanche, mai 4, 2014
```

Am I missing something? In the end I ended up using 'When:' and it worked. Which makes no sense.
