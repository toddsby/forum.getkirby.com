Text: This is really peskyâ€¦ I have many of this errors in my php_error.log:
```
`[24-Mar-2013 19:04:16 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 104857600 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 9000001 bytes) in ~/site/plugins/thumb/thumb.php on line 235`
```
I'm using Thumbs for generating an 2000px width images from "original" bigger photographs with > 4500px width.

System: php5.4.4 with `memory_limit = 256MB`.

Some one have solutions?
