Text: I'm using the thumb plugin to general a picturefill output and need to get the resized dimension of the image.

If I use:

    <span data-width="<?php echo $i->fitHeight(500)->width() ?>">
        <span data-src="<?php echo $i->thumb(...) ?>"></span>
    </span>

The output thumb image is cropped to the 500 height set by fitHeight regardless of what height I use thumb() to generate.  From what I can find though, this should only calculate and not alter the dimensions.

Hopefully I'm overlooking something.

Thanks!
