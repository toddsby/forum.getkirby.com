Text: @bastianallgeier I didn't have time to test it lats week, but it's not completely working the way I would like to with Markdown Extra enabled.

The ‘figure’ and ‘img’ tags also need to be added to the following lines in the markdown.extra.php file:

**Line 1631:**
`var $block_tags_re = 'p|div|h[1-6]|blockquote|pre|table|dl|ol|ul|address|form|fieldset|iframe|hr|legend|figure';`

**Line 1634:**
`var $context_block_tags_re = 'script|noscript|math|ins|del|img';`

_Any reason why you didn't add those?_

Possible to add this to the defaults.php by default as well:

`c::set('markdown.extra.blocktags', '...')`
`c::set('markdown.extra.context.blocktags', '...')`

Thanks,
J.
