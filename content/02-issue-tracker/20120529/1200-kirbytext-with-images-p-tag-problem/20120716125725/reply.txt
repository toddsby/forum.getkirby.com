Text: @jolantis ah, damn! I missed those :( Just added them to the dev branch. I didn't add them to the config though, because I need to make some bigger changes to the markdown extra file before I can do so â€“ they are directly declared as class variables and I can't use c::get() there. I actually don't want to mess the original files up too much so I will have to take a look how I can implement that in a good way first. 

Thanks for the heads-up!
