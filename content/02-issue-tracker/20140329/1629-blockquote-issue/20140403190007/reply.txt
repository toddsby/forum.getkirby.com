Text: I'm not sure attribution really belongs inside the quote, but if you really want it there, you could do something like:

    > Nullam absum lorem ipsum
    > - Author Name

> Nullam absum lorem ipsum
> - Author Name

I think you also need to have markdown line breaks set to true in the config for that to work.

    c::set('markdown.breaks', true);
