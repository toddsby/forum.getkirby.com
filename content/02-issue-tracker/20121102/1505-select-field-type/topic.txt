Text: We are looking into using Kirby for our web projects.. looking great so far, but we are running into a little problem.

We're trying to use the select field type in a blueprint:

   medium:
  	label: Medium
  	type: select
  	options:
  	  apple
  	  orange
  	  pear
  	default: orange

We would expect this to make a dropdown with the three values and to store either 'apple', 'orange' or 'pear' in the text file.. instead it stores the index of the value..

this is fine of course when you only ever edit through the panel.. but what if you also enjoy editing the text files directly.. an index of 1 doesn't tell me anything..
