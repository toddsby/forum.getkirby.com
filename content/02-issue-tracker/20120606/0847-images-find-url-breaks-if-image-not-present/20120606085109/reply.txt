Text: Thanks for the nice words about Kirby. 

The `->find('decoration.jpg')` returns false instead of an image object if the image could not be found. This means that all methods and getters are not available afterwards. So this is not a bug. 

You should build in a check if the image has been found in such a case: 


```
<?php $image = $article->images()->find('decoration.png') ?>

<?php if($image): ?>
<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" />
<?php endif ?>
```

I hope this helps.
