Text: Hi,
I have some issues with images in Kirby.

Code from my template file: http://codepad.org/JGKfiD2L

Everything works fine on my local server, but when I uploaded site to the production server images urls looks like this: http://onelovehiphop.pl/content120-wspolny-projekt-pezet-x-jimek/image.jpg

Anyone got similar problem?
