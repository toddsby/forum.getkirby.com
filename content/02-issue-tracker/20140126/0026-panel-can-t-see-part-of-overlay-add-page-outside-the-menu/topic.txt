Text: I have many clients using Kirby Panel without any problems but one client has this weird issue.

When he clicks the + button to add a new page, only the left white bit of .overlay.add-page div is visible. The part outside the .menu div is not visible, although the overflow property for .menu is set to auto.

Removing the overflow:auto property for .menu seems to fix the problem.
