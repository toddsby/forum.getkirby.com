Text: Recently I got some strange redirect for any file assigned to the page:

```
http://demo.site.com/WjRQO/assets/js/scripts.js
redirects to:
http://demo.site.com/assets/js/scripts.js

http://demo.site.com/WjRQO/assets/images/image.jpg
redirects to:
http://demo.site.com/assets/images/image.jpg

etc.
```

Also the "**WjRQO**" is change after some period to a different text like: YmOWQ etc.

P.S. Yes I have the latest version of Kirby and Panel.
