Text: A code snippet I found on this forum is causing me trouble :

    <?php $image = $article->images()->find('featured.jpg') ?>
		         <?php if($image): ?>
			         <img class="featured" src="<?php echo $images->url() ?>">
		        <?php endif ?>

This previous code that worked fine on one local install I had doesn't work on the one I used with 1.1.1. 

If the "featured" image is found then nothing below this code will appear. 

Did I miss something ? This is the code I have before :


    <?php $articles = $pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->paginate(5) ?>
		    <?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>

And the code I have after : 

   				
  				<h2><a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo html($article->title()) ?></h2>
   				
   				
   				
   				<aside class="entry-meta">
   				 <time><?php echo $article->date('d M Y') ?></time> | Tags:
   				  	<?php foreach(str::split($article->tags()) as $tag): ?>
   				  	<a class="tag" href="<?php echo url('blog/tag:' . urlencode($tag)) ?>"> #<?php echo html($tag) ?></a>
   				  	<?php endforeach ?>
   				 </aside>
   				 
   				 
   				 <div class="entry-content">
   				 	
   				 	
   				 	<?php echo kirbytext($article->text()) ?>
   				 
   				 </div>


Any help appreciated. Thanks
