Text: Or, when checking for a field, Kirby should return false if it exists but is empty.

Currently, if I have an optional field, editing or creating an entry in the panel creates that field whether it's left empty or not. That means this code:

    <?= ($page->fulltitle()) ? blah : blah ?>

Will return true when in fact it should be false. Meaning I have to instead use this obnoxious code:

    <?= ($page->fulltitle() != "") ? blah : blah ?>

So there are two options for fixes:

1. Make the panel not create these fields in the text file if they're left empty or
2. Have $page->blah() return false if the field exists but is empty.
