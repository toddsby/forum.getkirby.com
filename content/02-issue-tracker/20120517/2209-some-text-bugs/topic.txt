Text: Hello, does anyone have the same issues with text in some browsers (Chrome mostly but also firefox)? It looks like a div came in front or something, it's kind of truncated. I took a screenshot here for it! "http://i.imgur.com/Z2mcj.png". 
First i tried to load the .css right from the header with the html call but that did not change anything.
It only appears on the first visit to a website, after one refresh or some browsing the problem disappear.
PS: Kirby is just a great tool! Thanks!
