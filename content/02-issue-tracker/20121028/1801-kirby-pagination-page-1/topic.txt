Text: There is some way to remove or maybe redirect that weird `page:1` from pagination?

Current Kirby result:
```
http://site.com/blog/page:1
http://site.com/blog/page:2
http://site.com/blog/page:3
```

Desired correct result:
```
http://site.com/blog/
http://site.com/blog/page:2
http://site.com/blog/page:3
```

Or maybe the standard view for *future* Kirby updates:
```
http://site.com/blog/
http://site.com/blog/page/2
http://site.com/blog/page/3
```
