Just tried to use that - gives me an error, without displaying anything. 
The same error appears to be on your [demo](http://getkirby.com/sitemap.xml).

I think its because there was something already sent out before the

    header('Content-type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"');

,because it is appearing when I comment it out. But with the wrong header of course.

Any way to fix that?
