Text: That's a problem with auto-line-breaks implemented in Kirbytext. In Markdown you normally have to add three spaces to the end of line to force a line-break. In Kirbytext this is been done automatically, but this also leads to those unwanted br tags in nested lists. 

You can switch off the auto-line-break feature in your config: 

```php
<?php c::set('markdown.breaks', false); ?>
```

but this will also mean that you have to use the three spaces syntax afterwards. 

I'm also trying to find a fix for this.
