Text: Hi all,

I'm using this code inside my article template:

    <?php if($page->hasNext()): ?>
    <a href="<?php echo $page->next()->url() ?>">Next Â»</a>
    <?php endif ?>

The problem is that an article which is "invisible" shows up at http://www.ruehlpublishinghouse.com/articles/photocritic-logo-interview

*Am I missing something or did I not understand the concept of hiding pages? ;)*

Thanks a lot
