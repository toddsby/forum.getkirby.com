Text: I'm seeing a lot of solutions here but are any of these technically the best way of going about this? Is it safe? Could someone elaborate?

Also, what are the downsides of adding "AddHandler php5-cgi .php" to your .htaccess file?

I'd love to help get this resolved if I knew where to start!
