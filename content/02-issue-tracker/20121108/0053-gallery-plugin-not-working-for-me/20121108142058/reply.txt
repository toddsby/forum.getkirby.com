This is the snippet I'm using:
[github gallery snippet](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/snippets/gallery/gallery.php)

My code:

    Title: Drawings
    ----
    Description: Some drawings that I make in my free time or in boring
    meetings.
    ----
    Text:

    <h2>Some funny fish</h2>

    I'd like to make a project with these fish one day. Maybe a kids book.
