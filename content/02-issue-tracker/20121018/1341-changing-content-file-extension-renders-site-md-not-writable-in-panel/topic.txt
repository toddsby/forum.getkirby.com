Text: If you change the file extension in site *config.php* file, say to 'md':
		
	c::set('content.file.extension', 'md');
	
You can longer edit the 'site.md' in Panel (Edit Info), as it seems to be looking for the file with a '.txt' extension. I cannot immediately see where this is to suggest a fix, but the error is:

	content/site.txt is not writable.
	Please change its permissions and try again
