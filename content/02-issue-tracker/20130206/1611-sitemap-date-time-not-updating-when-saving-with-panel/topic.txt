Text: Is anyone else having problem with a sitemap not updating when saved from Panel? 

Everything saves OK, but sitemap does not pick up the changes in date/time. If I manually open the '.md' file (we use the .md extension) in an FTP client then save it sitemap updates the date/time. 

No cache, or anything else, does the same on two servers? Latest Kirby/Panel all browsers caches cleared. Standard sitemap.php code.

Interestingly the date/time is set correctly when you save from panel.

Any ideas?
