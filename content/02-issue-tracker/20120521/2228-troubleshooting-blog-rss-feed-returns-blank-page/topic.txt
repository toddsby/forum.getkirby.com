Text: First of all, awesome work on this CMS.

So I followed your steps in the tutorial and created a blog. Next, I followed your steps and created a RSS feed for the blog (mydomain.com/kirby/blog). When I navigate to the feed page (mydomain.com/kirby/blog/feed), it just returns a blank page. I'm pretty sure I correctly put the code snippets where they should go.

I tried this on my local Windows XAMPP install and on two different servers with the same results.

Am I missing something? Is there something I should tweak in the code you provided in the tutorial?


Note: I wasn't sure where to put this topic. Perhaps you should make some more forum categories?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
