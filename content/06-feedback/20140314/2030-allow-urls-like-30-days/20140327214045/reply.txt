Text: @fitzage That is actually a really clever workaround to this problem. That just saved part of my structure on my site. Great thanks!

I however still think it would be great to be able to disable visible pages in the settings, to make these kinds of urls easier to manage in the folder structure.

I tried some other cases that did not work:

 - 0-30-days
 - 1-31-days

See the pattern? The first has "0-" two times and the next has "1-" two times. So watch out for similar numbers if using this method.

Other solutions are welcome if any.
