Text: When adding a number and a minus like...

    30-

Kirby think I want to use this page in a menu and then strip the numbers. The page url will be...

    my-domain/days

It would be great to have an option to keep the url as it is:

    my-domain/30-days

"BTW: numbers will automatically be stripped in URLs, so the folder 01-about will get the URL http://yourdomain.com/about"
