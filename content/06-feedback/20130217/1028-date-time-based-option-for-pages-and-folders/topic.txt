Text: Date/Time based order option as well as the current numerical order of pages and folders.
Mainly for blogs or news type folders and pages. 
e.g. ISO date 2013/12/31 (year/month/date)

It would of course be nice if the URL controlled the display e.g.

+ blog/2013 - gives all the articles for 2013
+ blog/2013/02 - gives all the articles for Feb 2013
+ blog/2013/02/22 - gives all the articles for 22nd Feb 2013

But I guess you can do this in code.

Or something similar ;-)
