Text: Don't have a code example, but I think what you have to do is roughly the following:

- get today's date in a variable
- get your events using the code plartz posted above
- loop through your events to check if the date of each event lies in the future compared to your "today" variable. If it's in the future, add 1 to an index variable.
- Once your loop has reached an event that lies in the past, end the loop and slice your veranstaltungen array at the index number.

After doing that you should be left with all of your future events which you can then output on your homepage.
