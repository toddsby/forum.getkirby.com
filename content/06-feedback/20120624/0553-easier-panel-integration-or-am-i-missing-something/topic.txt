Text: I was wondering if I am the only one that finds adding the Panel to a site is tedious because of the folder and file permissions?

Maybe I am missing an easy way to do this?

- Terminal: I rather not use terminal but if that has a way to separately set permission on folders and files to their numbers, I'd love to know

- Finder: as far as I know Finder does not work with numbers for permissions.

- Panic's Transmit: I used this now. I thought if I first set permissions to the 'content' folder to 666 and apply to enclosed items it would take care of all files. Then I selected all folders and applied 755 to just the folders.

Looks like this does not go in deeper than 1 level of folders.

Also I am still not allowed to create a new page even with the content folder set to 755.

And then there is the question about the 'Please fix first!' messages. Are these supposed to go away when all is well?
