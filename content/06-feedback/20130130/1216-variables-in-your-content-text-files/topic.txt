Text: It would be great to define variables in an extra file (something like vars.php in your site/vars folder) which you could use out of your content text files. Two examples:

### User data
My protected page content file:

	title: Welcome $username

My output would be something like "Welcome Jakob" ($username is not the panel user, but the one which is logged in on the page – with the Auth plugin).

### Search
On my search.txt:

	title: Search for $query

My output: "Search for 'dates'"

Of course, I could do that in my templates – but it would be nice to use it just like this, though.
