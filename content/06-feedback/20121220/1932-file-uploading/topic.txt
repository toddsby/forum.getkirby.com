Text: I’d love to see the file uploading process simplified.

Right now the steps to upload a file are:

1. Go to Files tab
2. Click Upload a new file
3. Click Choose File
4. Browse for a file, click Choose
5. Click Upload

Seems like a lot of redundant steps, to me, as for every Kirby interface button (Upload a new file) there’s another default system button (Choose File) which means/does the same thing.

It’d be super neat to see drag-and-drop brought to the file area. Maybe even drag-and-drop right to the spot in your content text.
