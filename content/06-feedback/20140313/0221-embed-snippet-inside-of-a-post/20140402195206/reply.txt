Text: @fitzage Getting close! It's printing out the snippet but the only problem is it's treating everything like markdown when I just want it to stay html.

I've tried:

	function module($params) {
	    $html = file_get_contents($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . '/site/snippets/' . $params['module'] . '.php');
	    echo $html;
	}

...but this repeats the same problem as before where it'll render the snippet out of place.

I've also tried `echo html($html);` and `return html($html);` but neither of those are converting it to proper HTML.

So close! Any ideas?
