Text: **The Problem**

After a year of using Kirby, I've found that I'm creating a lot more templates and blueprints than should be necessary. Every time, it comes down to the need of putting a snippet in the middle of the page's content.

Example:

Template 1) header snippet, body snippet, footer snippet
Template 2) header, body1, custom snippet #1, body2, footer
Template 3) header, body1, custom snippet #2, body2, footer

All of these templates are really the exact same look, with the only exception being the custom snippet in the middle of the content.

**Proposed Solution**

If it were possible to embed a snippet, perhaps like [snippet name="custom1"], this would considerably cut down on the number of templates AND blueprints needed, while opening up a lot more flexibility.

I've tried to think of other possible solutions, but this seems like the most powerful and elegant. Hope you consider this!
