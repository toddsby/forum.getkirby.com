Text: @fitzage Ah, thanks for pointing me in the right direction! Your method will definitely be handy for the future. Just right now, I'm specifically trying to use snippets.

I'm having an issue with this, but here's what I have in my kirbytext.extended.php:

	class kirbytextExtended extends kirbytext {
		function __construct($text, $markdown=true) {
			parent::__construct($text, $markdown);
		
			$this->addTags('module');
		}
		function module($params) {
			snippet($params['module']);
		}
	}

I'm testing this on a page with this in the body:

	xxx(module: products)xxx

But when I view the page, it actually displays things like:

	[html for Products snippet here]
	xxxxxx

Any ideas why my snippet is appearing in the wrong place?
