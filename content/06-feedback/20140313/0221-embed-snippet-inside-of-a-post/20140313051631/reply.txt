Text: A couple of options:

1. Have two separate body text fields, and then have a third field that you use in your template to tell it which snippet to use. So you'd have fields for body1, body2, and snippet. Snippet would be a single word that you use to embed your snippet in your template between where you echo the two text fields.
2. Create a custom kirbytext extension that does one of two things:
    * Tells it where to embed the snippet, as you mention above (I'm not entirely sure how to do this).
    * Tells it what content file to pull text from (I've actually done this).

So depending on what needs to go in those custom snippets, you could just make them content fields either in your site.txt, or in some other directory. I don't have time to pass my kirbytext extension along, but for one section I have a folder called modules (that's invisible) with a number of pages that only have two fields each: title and text. Then I use my kirbtext extension to just pull the correct one based on the slug.

If you're interested in that, I'll share it.
