Text: Hey, you can use this simple code to force deletion of the cache.

Although when you edit a page cache is updated.

	<?php

		function resetCache($folder)
		{
		    foreach(glob($folder . "/*") as $files_folder)
		    {
		        unlink($files_folder) or die("IMPOSIBLE delete file  ***</br>n");
		        echo $files_folder . " - DELETE OK </br>n";
		    }
		 
		}


		$cacheDir = (dirname(__FILE__).'/site/cache');

		resetCache($cacheDir) ;

		echo "<p>The reset cache files is Ok...</p>";

	?>
