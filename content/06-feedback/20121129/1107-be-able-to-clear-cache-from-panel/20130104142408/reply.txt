Text: There's even a simpler method to clean the cache: 

```
<?php cache::flush() ?>
```

When combined with a little param check you can build your own cache flush api in one of your templates for example. 

```
<?php 

if(params('flush-cache') == 'secret-cache-flushing-password') {
  cache::flush();
}

?>
```

You could include that in the header snippet or a custom plugin file. Afterwards you can flush the cache like this:
