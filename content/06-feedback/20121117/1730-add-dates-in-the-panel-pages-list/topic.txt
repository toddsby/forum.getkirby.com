Text: I do it for myself, but it could be nice, adding the date - when a date field is available - on the list. 

More easy to find a page when the date is important - like band shows or blog articles.

	<a href="<?php echo $child->url() ?>" class="title">
	<?php if ($child->date()) echo html($child->date('Y/m/d'))." - "; echo html($child->title()) ?>
	</a>

Maybe a new blueprint setting to handle it easily !
