Text: I made a slight tweak to the Kirby Panel by making the left sidebar menu (desktop view) fixed position so it's always viewable on long pages with a lot of fields.

Here's a side-by-side view (newly fixed on the left): <http://cl.ly/LkRb>

Change line 171 from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed` in the file `screen.css` under `panel > assets > css`.

Maybe this could be useful for everyone and make its way into the next release.
