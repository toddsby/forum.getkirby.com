Text: Perhaps adding in meta text to the various pages that are useful when viewing your panel
* preview buttons next to each article when that page is displayed
* version number in footer of both panel and kirby
* last edited datetime for each entry when page displayed
* server time
* customizable links to thinks like the /mint/ page for analytics or anything else.
I'm sure you can come up with a ton of ideas!
