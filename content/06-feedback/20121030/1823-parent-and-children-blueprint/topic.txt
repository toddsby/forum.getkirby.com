Text: ###Hi there!

I am about to make a website for a client and i wanted to vary the layout really easily by using a content templating systemâ€¦

---

###The concept

In fact it is simply about adding the an option to blueprint that actually limit them to be used only if they are the children of certain parents

---

###In other word:

The **Slide** blueprint would be available under the **Slider** that could only be the child of **project** pages!

---

###Exemple of structure (the one i need for my project)


1Page Blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 Page content layout 1 blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 Slider Blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.1 Slide Blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 Page content layout 3 blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 Page content layout 4 blueprint

---

###This could be also applied to other contexts as well

1 Client Blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 Project Blueprint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.1 Work Blueprint

###And if you are too busy

I could work with that with you since i need this!
