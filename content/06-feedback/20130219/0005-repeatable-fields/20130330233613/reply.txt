Text: I know this topic is already a bit older but I was wondering whether my idea on how to solve your problem is just »too simple« or why no-one else thought about adding subpages?


    - socialmedia/
      - facebook/
      - twitter/
      - flickr/
      - dribble/

-

    foreach($pages->find('socialmedia')->children()):
      // do stuff here
    endif;

You could safe this into a snippet.
