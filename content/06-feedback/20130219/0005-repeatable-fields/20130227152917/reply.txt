Text: A good example use-case for a repeatable field would be social media links.

Right now in the Panel, you have to define text inputs for *each* social media link. They all have the same elements though, a name (e.g. Twitter), a URL (e.g. twitter.com/tysongach) and maybe an icon too. If in the future, you want to add or remove, you'll have to go to your blueprint for that template and do so.

With repeatable fields, you could define those core elements (name, URL, icon) as a repeatable group, and then the Panel would have an add/remove button next to each of these field groups, allowing you to easily add as many or as little social media links as you want, right in the Panel.
