Text: Hi all,

I'm not sure if this has been suggested yet (can't find it!) but something that could be useful is the ability to have 'repeatable' fields via the Panel.

I'm building a site for a client and one request was that they can add content to a template that would then be passed into Campaign Monitor and generated into an email campaign ready for send out. (Already building it here: http://goo.gl/vPqEB)

This would allow them to house an archive of email campaigns on the site and create a pretty easy email template builder for them too.

So, repeatable fields. It would be good if I could wrap a certain block of code in the blueprint in a 'repeatable element' which could then be repeated as often as they want.

For example:

Title field
Text field

This could be repeated, or removed per individual campaign they created. Each new campaign would default to the standard set of fields.

Just an idea... could be useful outside of my specific email template needs to allow users to dynamically created new areas without the template defining it so strictly. Could work.

Cheers!
