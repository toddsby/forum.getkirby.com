Text: I see that I can create a page called foo and a template called foo, and another page called bar and a template called bar. But how do I create just one template like three-columns that could be applied to pages foo and bar? A symlink won't work because foo and bar will be created after three-columns is created. I know what templates I'll need, but I don't know what pages I'll need after that. Thanks.
