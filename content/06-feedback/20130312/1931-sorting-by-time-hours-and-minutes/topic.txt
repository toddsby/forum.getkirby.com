Text: Someone was able to `sortBy('time', 'desc')` with hours and minutes?

I think it's very important, especially if you publish more than one article a day. In fact if using only `sortBy('date', 'desc')` articles that published in the same day is automatically sorted by their titles, which is not so flexible.

article.php
```php
<?php $articles = $pages->find('articles')
                        ->children()
                        ->visible()
                        ->sortBy('date', 'desc');
                        ->sortBy('time', 'desc'); ?>

<?php foreach($articles as $article): ?>
<article>
  <h1>
    <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo $article->title() ?></a>
  </h1>
</article>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

Currently in Panel there's only manual way to put time
```

**NOTE**: My current solution is to use also: `flip()`
