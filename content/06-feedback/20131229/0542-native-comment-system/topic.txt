Text: I'd really really like to see a native comment system for Kirby.

Features of what I'd like to have:

  - Social Integration (login with Twitter **or** Facebook).
  - Comment like (+1) count feature (already developed, just have to implement).
  - Moderation (hide and delete comments).
  - Spam protection.
  - Allow us the option to control the html (for styling the comments).
  - AJAX (new comments post live on the site).
  - Database (a file system may not be ideal to store comments).
<br>
#### Most importantly it needs to be incredibly easy to install/setup.

_And yes, I'd be willing to pay for this._
