Text: Hi there,

I am currently creating a portfolio page on my site and am adapting some code from the Themis theme so that my content shows up as a grid with tag filters. I have run into an issue with the tagcloud plugin â€” when I navigate to the portfolio page it shows me the following warning:

Fatal error: Call to a member function url() on a non-object on line 12 of the tagcloud.php file

It is pointing to the 'baseurl' line under defaults in this array:

	 // default values
 	  $defaults = array(
	 'limit'    => false,
	 'field'    => 'tags',
	 'children' => 'visible',
	 'baseurl'  => $parent->url(),
	 'param'    => 'tag',
	 'sort'     => 'name',
	 'sortdir'  => 'asc'
	 );

At the moment I am clueless as to what this indicates. 

I am still a beginner with all of this, and would appreciate your help.

Thank you!
