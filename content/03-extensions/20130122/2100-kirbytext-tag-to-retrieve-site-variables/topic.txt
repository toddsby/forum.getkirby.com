Text: Hey, 

so I'm trying to write a tag that will retrieve `$site` variables, like say an admin's e-mail address. Should work like this:

```markdown
(site_var: admin-email)
```

... and I'm following the 'wikipedia' example in the tutorial, but I just don't know what to write on the `return` line. This is as far as I've gotten for that part (I'm following the standard template for the rest of it, it's just the function part that I don't know how to write, so I'm only including that here):

``` php
function site_var($params) {
	$variable = $params['site_var'];
	return $site->$variable(); // this is def. wrong
}
```

Any ideas?
