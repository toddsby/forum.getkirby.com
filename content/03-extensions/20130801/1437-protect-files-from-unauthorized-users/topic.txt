Text: Hello everybody, 

I was experimenting with the Auth plugin and am now struggling with the issue of file protection. 

My possible Client wishes to offer a password protected area where students can find downloads. 

Now I was wondering if there was a feasible way to protect these files from direct access. 

Any Ideas?
