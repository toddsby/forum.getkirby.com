Text: I love kirby and the release it offers from db but I still want a bit more centralisation of data.  I have a lot of information on a long list of paintings and I don't want to have to create and update lots of single files.

Perhaps using the file based approach we could draw data from a csv file and a folder of images to use throughout the site.

I've already worked out the central gallery but not the metadata.

I started a post on stackoverflow to describe my idea and my progress towards it.
