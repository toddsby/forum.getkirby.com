Text: [Draft](https://draftin.com) is a really neat browser-based writing app, with features like Markdown editing, version-control, team collaboration and publishing (plus [*much* more](http://docs.withdraft.com)).

Draft already has built-in publishing to services like WordPress, Tumblr and MailChimp, so you can write in Draft and then send that document straight to any of these services.

Although Kirby is not a built-in publishing source (maybe it should be, maybe not?), Draft does have [webhooks support](http://docs.withdraft.com/#webhooks), so you can push documents out to your own services.

Has anyone set this up? Thoughts? Would anyone be interested in this?
