Text: Hey guys, does it really work? 
I tried it, but the custom field is not showing in the mail.

My setup:

```php 
    $form = new contactform(array(
       'to'       => 'Mail <mail@mail.com>',
       'from'     => 'Mail <mail@mail.com>',
       'subject'  => 'Anfrage',
       'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:sent',
       'required' => array('name', 'email', 'item', 'text'),
       'keep'     => array('name', 'email', 'item', 'text')
    ));
```

...and in the contactform.mail.php file it looks like this:

    Hallo,

    hier ist eine neue Nachricht vom Kontakformular:

    Name: {name}
    ---------
    Email: {email}
    ---------
    Location: {item}
    ---------
    Text:  {text}

Name, Email & Text show up as intended, but the location item and the intro text is missing in the mail. Has someone discovered similar problems and solved them? 

I think it is more a trouble with the contactform.mail.php which is not working?

*Edit*
Solved the issue: Better don't copy the snippets of the plugin in a subfolder.
