Text: I came across this topic as well when implementing a form the other day. I have a small addition to the code above.

It's better to not change the plugin code, but set the 'required' and 'keep' fields when creating the contactform object.

```php

$form = new contactform(array(
  'to'       => 'My Name <name@domain.tld>',
  'from'     => 'My Website <name@domain.tld>',
  'subject'  => 'New entry in contactform!',
  'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:sent',
  'required' => array('name', 'email', 'project', 'description'),
  'keep'     => array('name', 'email', 'phone', 'project', 'description')
));

```
