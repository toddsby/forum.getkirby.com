Text: The image tag "&lpar;image:.... &rpar;" available in the default set of api's of Kirbytext really works great, but I needed a couple of things in addition:
- I wanted the image to be shown inside a div, to have more control on the result
- I wanted to add a caption and display it under the image.

So I wrote this little extension to accomplish that, I hope you may find it useful.
