Text: I downloaded and installed the Extension Highlight:

<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/highlight>

All files are in the correct directories on the server.
But nothing works.
I wrote
```php
	
function f(){
 foreach($arr as $item){
  continue;
 }
}



and on the page it looks as this:

function f(){

                foreach($arr as $item){

                        continue;

                }

        }
Can anybody help me?

Thank you!
