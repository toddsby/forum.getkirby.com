Text: I just want to register enthusiasm for this functionality-to-be. My use case is probably simpler than even the current plugin provides: I'd like to imitate what I currently get from a posterous site, where access is simply restricted by a single password gate with no users or roles management at all. (On re-reading, this sounds something like the original poster's request, too.)
