Text: After ironing out a couple of minor issues, I was able to make it work partially - it now authenticates, but every time I navigate away from that page, and come back to it, or for that matter, even go to another blog page, it asks me for a password again.

Would be really cool if the panel plugin's user login bit could be extended for this functionality. Not sure if that is possible

In the mean time, I will continue to try and make this work.
