Text: I'm trying to add a simple math-based captcha as described at (link:http://getkirby.com/forum/extensions/topic:167).

I thought the best place to validate the result would be in site/plugins/contactform/contactform.php, in the validate function. I tried adding this:

    if ($self->value('spam') != $_SESSION['capres']) { $self->addInvalid('spam'); }

But I got errors that `$_SESSION` is not defined. I also tried this:

    if ($self->value('spam') != s::get('capres')) { $self->addInvalid('spam'); }

No errors now, but it also rejects every answer whether right or wrong.

What do I need to do to make this check in the validate function? Or is there someplace else that would be better?
