Text: Okay, have tried to install the contact form plugin, followed the simple steps as outlined on the Git page, but am getting the following error message when viewing the page:

Hey, your contact form has been submitted Name: {name} --------- Email: {email} --------- Text: {text}
Fatal error: Class 'contactform' not found in /<path to site>/site/plugins/contactform/contactform.php on line 3

Any ideas anyone?
