You might have found 'contactform' in kirbycms-extensions under snippets OR plugins. **ITS BOTH**, it's a snippet and a plugin.

In the kirbycms-extensions download under /plugins, you need the folder called 'contactform'. 

That plugins/contactform folder goes into your site/plugins.

INSIDE of that 'contactform' folder, there is a folder called 'snippets'. [site/plugins/contactform/snippets]

Inside of 'snippets' folder are the files, 'contactform.php' and 'contactform.mail.php'. 
_[these same files can also be found in the snippets folder in the kirbycms-extensions download]_

Move those two files and add them directly into your own Kirby site/snippets folder.
 
Than you proceed as the readme instructions and change your mail values and embed the form within your page using &lt;?php snippet('contactform') ?>

Hope that helps
