Text: I'm having the same error and I'd really like to fix it.  Here's the text of my error: 

Fatal error: Class 'contactform' not found in /home/binghamt/public_html/m.binghamtonyoga.com/site/plugins/contactform/contactform.php on line 3

Here's my situation:
* Running PHP version 5.3.21
* My snippets folder has two files in it: 
   (1) contactform.php
   (2) contactform.mail.php
* I've created a plugins/contactform folder and tested it two ways:
   (1) With nothing in it, I get the Fatal Error
   (2) With copies of both of the snippet files, I get a the same Fatal Error
* I've added < ?php snippet('contactform') ? > to my template

What have I done wrong?
