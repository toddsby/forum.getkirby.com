Text: [Being a bit frustrated](http://getkirby.com/forum/feedback/topic:1165) with not being able to inject code into snippets I have written [a small extension](https://gist.github.com/nils-werner/9686081) for Kirby that allows you to do that:

Using it you can basically do the following in your snippet:

    <?php section::get('submenu') ?>

 and optionally in your template something like
 
    <?php section::start('submenu') ?>
        This content will be injected into the snippet.
    <?php section::end() ?>

The code between `section::start` and `section::end` will be rendered everywhere you run `section::get`, may it be in your template or in a snippet.

Setting the section is entirely optional, if you don't set one nothing will be rendered.
