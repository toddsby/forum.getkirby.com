Text: Mmm, it worked for me...not tested, but perhaps something like:

```php
<h3>Image loop of Children - getting first image in child folder<h3>
 <?php $article = $pages->find('article') ?>
 <ol>
 <?php foreach($articles as $image): ?>
  <li><?php echo $image->images()->first()->url() ?><br/>
      <?php echo html($image->title()) ?>
    </li
</ol>
<?php endforeach ?>
```
