Text: I'm using the contact form plugin. It works with the default mail() function, but with the Mailgun service, I get:

curl_setopt_array(): CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION cannot be activated when safe_mode is enabled or an open_basedir is set ...

I'm new to Mailgun and I supsect this is a problem with how I've set things up there, or the settings on my server.

Just wondering if anyone has run into this.
