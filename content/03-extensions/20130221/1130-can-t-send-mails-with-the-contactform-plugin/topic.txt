Text: Hi!

I've implemented the Contactform Plugin in a page as described by Bastian (link:https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/contactform#contactform-plugin--snippets-alpha text: here popup: yes) 
I can fill out my form, but if I try to send something the only error I get is: "The email could not be sent. Please try again later."

Anyone an idea? Did I miss something?

I'm running with Hosteurope with PHP Version 5.3.21

Thanks for your help,
Oli
