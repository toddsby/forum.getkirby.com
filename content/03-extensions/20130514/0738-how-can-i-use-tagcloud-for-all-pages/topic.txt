Text: Hi there, I'm trying to create a tagcloud for all pages, currently I struggle with a few things:

`<?php $tags= tagcloud($pages->find(''), array('limit' => 20)) ?>`

This doesn't seem to work. Is it simply not possible?

Assuming there's a fix for this my next issue is that there's not much documentation on how to return a results list, I think I may be able to borrow this one from the search plugin.

How do I set up a results page for tags outside of a blog?

Many thanks and keep up the good work!
