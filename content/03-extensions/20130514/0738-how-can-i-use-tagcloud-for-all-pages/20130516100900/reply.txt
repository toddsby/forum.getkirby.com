Not sure what you are trying to achieve here, maybe too early ;-)

What normally happens is say for an 'articles' index page template you have normal display code, but if a `tag:Test`  is set in the URL then the code just list items with those tags. 
e.g.
```php
<?php
if(param('tag')) {
...
} else {
...
}
?>
```

That all works fine.
`http://foobar.dev/articles/tag:Test`

If you do this for the whole site, how are you going to filter what to display when `tag:Test` is set or are you just planing on listing links to them? If so you may have to alter the URL with it's path to link to a page/subpage...
