I do run into another issue now though as I am going for the way the kirby demo does the pagination.

It used a snippet called pagination but for some reason the query value is not added to the prev and next links.

```php
<? if($pagination->hasNextPage()): ?>
    <a class="next" href="<?= $pagination->nextPageURL() ?>">next &rsaquo;</a>
<? endif ?>
```

I have set paginate to 8 and when there are more results it now shows the next page link but its URL only says "?page=2" so without the value for q

Adding $search->query() to this didnt help.
