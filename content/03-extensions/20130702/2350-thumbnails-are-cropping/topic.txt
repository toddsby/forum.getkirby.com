Text: I'm presently trying to get the thumbnail plugin working. Using the code below, all of the thumbnails are coming up cropped instead of resized.

    <img class="screenshot" src="<?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 280), false) ?>" alt="<?php echo $project->title() ?>" />

Any idea why this might be the case?

Note: I am returning the data url instead of the full image tag so that once I get this working I can add support for Retina images. Everything is working fine if I pass true for the third argument, thereby letting the thumbnail plugin create the entire image tag.

Any ideas?
