Text: For some reason the Wordpress Exporter extension only imports about 300 characters of each post, possibly the Wordpress summary, instead of the entire post. Hmmmm...

edit: I think it's because of the <--more--> tag in Wordpress. Is there any way for this plugin to take from the RSS feed, which does not have the <--more--> tag?
