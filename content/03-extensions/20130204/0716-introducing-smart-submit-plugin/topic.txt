Text: For my own needs, I created a Smart Submit plugin for Kirby - it allows you to handle form submissions, without reloading the page. Honeypot spam protection is included.

To read how it works and download, please see this Github repo:

<https://github.com/vladstudio/vladstudio-kirby-smart-submit>

I use similar approach at my website here: 
<http://www.vladstudio.com>

You can see what I mean here:

(try submitting empty form, or you can actually send me a message :-)
This is not actual demo of Kirby plugin - the actual example is included in repo.

As any fellow developer, I'll be happy if you find this plugin useful or have a comment to share.

Thanks!
