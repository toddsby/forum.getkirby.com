Text: FYI - I made an update to Smart Plugin: <https://github.com/vladstudio/vladstudio-kirby-smart-submit>

You now need to define handler name right inside the form "action":

`<form id="smart-submit" action="<?= url('smart-submit') ?>?handler=do-something">`

and the handler would be

`content/smart-submit/do-something.php`

That allows you to use single handler on more than one page.
