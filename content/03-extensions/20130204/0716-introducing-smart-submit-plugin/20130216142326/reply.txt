kukac7: I cannot tell - it entirely depends on why you need the form.

Kirby CMS is designed for static web sites. Forms are interactive by nature. When user sends you some information using a form, you are supposed to do something with it.

Smart Submit plugin is "a hack" to make "doing something with user submitted information" easier.

For example, if you created a contact form, you may want to send the submitted info to your email.
