Text: Hello,

is there a way for logging in using the auth plugin without entering data in a form snippet? Yes, it surely sounds odd but I need to find a way for using a Basic DocCheck-Login ([DocCheck Website](http://lounge.doccheck.com/com/services/passwordprotection/)) alongside a default frontend authentication.

The Basic doccheck license secures the protected area of a website only by redirecting the visitor to the landing URL after checking the profession. ([PDF documentation](http://lounge.doccheck.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dc_lounge/pdf/en/DocCheck_Login_Manual_12.3_COM_01.pdf))

I've already tried it without luck using curl. What would be the best way to implement this?

Thanks a lot,
