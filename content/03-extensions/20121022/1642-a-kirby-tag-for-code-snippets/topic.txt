Text: I'm wondering if it's at all possibble to do a Kirby tag that would parse something like this:

    (code: <link href="sheet.css" media="(max-width: 500)">)

So I wouldn't have to write inline code snippets with entities (like this: <code>&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;code sample here&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;</code>) every time I want to give out a code snippet in a blog post.

I got close with this code:

    function code($params) {
      $string = '';
      foreach ($params as $key => $value) {
        if ($key=='code') {
          $string = $string.$value;
        }
        else {
          $string = $string.$key.': '.$value; 
        }
      }
      return '<code>'.html($string).'</code>';
    }

But it results in the following html:

    <code><link href="sheet.css" media="max-width: 500</code>">)

Kirby ends the tag in with the first ) it finds. Is there any way to try to do some parenthesis matching?
