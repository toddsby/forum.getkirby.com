Text: I like it, very simple and a good place to start from. 
I realise it's a beta but I've spotted some stuff which may help in a brief look...

+ Page weight is quite big. Lot of JS, lots of files and http calls. I cannot help thinking at least some of this could be better done with smaller combined JS and CSS3? ;-)
+ 'Search' txt doesn't vanish when I click on it?
+ No hover on small screen menu, just because it is small does not mean it is touch.
+ Not enough room for footer test on small screen.
+ The contact from is not very user-friendly with its' errors or accessible (no labels etc).
+ Probably still needs a bit more typographic styling even though it is a beta?

Hope this helps, keep up the good work!
