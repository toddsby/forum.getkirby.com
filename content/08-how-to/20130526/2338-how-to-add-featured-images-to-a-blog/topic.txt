Text: I'm migrating my blog over from WordPress to Kirby, and I have a lot of posts with featured images (images that are not part of the body text, but can be styled like post thumbnails). Here's how I dealt with them in Kirby:

In each blog post, I added the following field:

    FeaturedImg: image-filename.jpg
    ----

Then in the template, here's the code to show the image:

    <img src="<?php echo $page->images()->find(html($page->featuredimg()))->url() ?>" />

It took me a while to figure out how to implement this. I forgot about the `html()` function, which tripped me up. Hopefully this will be of some help to those looking to replicate WordPress's "featured image" functionality.
