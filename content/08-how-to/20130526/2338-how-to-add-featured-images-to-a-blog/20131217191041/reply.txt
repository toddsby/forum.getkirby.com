Text: So you'd name your image something like featured-blahblah.png and thenâ€¦

```php
<?php $featured = $page->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', 'featured-'); ?>
<img src="<?php echo $featured->url() ?>">
```

This method lets you include more words in the filename as long as it starts with `featured-`. This also means it works whether it's png or jpeg, or even gif I suppose.

If you don't need that flexibility (you're going to use the same filename and format every time), you can do this (obviously replacing featured.jpg with whatever the correct filename is):

```php
<?php $featured = $page->images()->find('featured.jpg'); ?>
<img src="<?php echo $featured->url() ?>">
```
