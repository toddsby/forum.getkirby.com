Just starting out with Kirby but need to do this on my freelance site before it goes live.

I have a blog on "site root/03-blog" and some test posts within but need to show the three most recent posts on the home page. How can I pull the recent posts from one level of the site to another, in this case up to the site root and show excepts there.

thanks
