Text: Hello everybody.
First of all thank you Julien for sharing your idea and solution.

I am trying to implement the code you have suggested, but I am not a web designer neither a developer so I have some problem.

I am trying to do it on my local machine using mamp.

I have created a file called "archive.php" with your code and put it into ../site/templates
At the same time I have created a page: ../content/04-archive and added a file called archive.txt

Unfortunately I receive: "Fatal error: Call to a member function children() on a non-object in /Users/fabiomacori/Dropbox/Personale/kirby/site/templates/archive.php on line 7"

Even if I delete :
                          ->children()
                          ->visible()
                          ->flip();
from: <?php
        $articles = $pages->find('articles')
                          ->children()
                          ->visible()
                          ->flip();
        $i=1;?>
I have a fatal error with following string.

Can you help me?
Thank you for your attention,
regards (and sorry for my poor english)
