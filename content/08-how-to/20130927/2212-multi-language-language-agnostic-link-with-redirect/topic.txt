Text: My personal blog is going to be multi language for a german and english audience, with promotional materials/church slides showing links to specific pages. I'd like to be able to send people to example.com/donate instead of having to specifically say en/donate de/donate

does anyone have a way to make the non language specific URL look at the user language string and auto redirect to the correct page?

Is this even possible?
