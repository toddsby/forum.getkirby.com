Text: Hey

I've re-read your posts and I still think Kirby is doing what it should.

Going to:

example.com/news

will redirect to the home page

going to:

example/com/en/sting

will show english, the default language

example.com/nl/string

will show dutch

You want the default language, say en to be at:

example.com/string

Kirby does not seem to support this - see my other post:

http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:907

What we want is to have the option for Kirby to rewrite the default language to remove the language code:

example.com/string

will show english or the default language

Sorry if this is not he answer your looking for - hopefully this can be sorted out in a next version of Kirby?

Remember that if there is no translation file for the current language, Kirby falls back to the default - I am sure this solves the original post?
