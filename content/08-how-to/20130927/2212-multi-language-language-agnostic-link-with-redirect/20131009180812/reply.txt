Text: i'd like to be able to have specific links that redirect to the language specific links.

such as www.website.com/imprint going to either the /en/imprint or /de/imprint or www.website.com/blog going to the /en/blog or /de/blog 

is there anyone who's made a plugin to do this? extending the current redirections in the language system.
