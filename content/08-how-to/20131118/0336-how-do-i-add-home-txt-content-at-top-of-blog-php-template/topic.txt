Text: Hi there,

I hard coded the content from my home page right into the blog.php template.

See my work hereâ€¦
www.artsydesigny.com  (The Blog is my homepage)

www.artsydesigny.com/home (this is the hidden home page)

I know I shouldn't have hard coded it right in. Is there PHP code I could put at the top instead that would grab the content from my home.txt Content file?

My skills in PHP are very limited.

Thanks for your help!
