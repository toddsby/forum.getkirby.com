A simple, easy to use theme for Kirby. 

     Dependencies:
     Jquery Isotope http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
     SimplecartJS http://simplecartjs.org/
     Skeleton Framework http://www.getskeleton.com/

This theme was only made quickly so is not yet fully complete but is there for people to use and improve on. The CSS could do with a bit of improvement and will eventually be made responsive with the aid of skeleton, at present it works OK on most browsers up to a certain point.

Any feedback appreciated
