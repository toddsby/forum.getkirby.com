Text: Thank you for the quick reply!

I went with a variant of solution #2, ran another foreach loop specifically to find About, while omitting About from the former loop.

It probably isn't the best way to do it, running a loop for a specific UID seems... excessive? But it works for my extremely limited knowledge of php, maybe I can revisit this when I am a little better at this.

Thanks again. (-:
