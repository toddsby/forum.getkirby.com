Text: There are a variety of options, depending on other factors or your preference.

1. Make the About page invisible (no number). Then for the other items, pull a list of visible items, and for the about item pull the invisible items.
2. Pull the About page by URL slug separately, then filter it out in the list of other pages.
3. Number the About page 0, and have all the other pages below that (similar to your current solution, but doesn't require an arbitrary number that might have to change later.

There are other methods that would be variations on #2. Like creating a specific field to filter by and things like that.
