Text: Hey everyone,

Just released an Image Picker panel field on github.

This is useful if you want your users to be able to pick a single image out to use for example as a "Featured Image"

[Check it out here](https://github.com/iandoe/kirbycms-panel-imagepicker-field)

Hope it will be of use to you.
