Text: Assuming you have a paginated set of pages in a variable (in this case `$articles`)

```php
echo 
'Page'.
$articles->pagination->countItems()
.' Articles - Page '.
$articles->pagination->page()
.' of '.
$articles->pagination->countPages();
  
```

Which would give you something like 
`10 Articles - Page 1 of 2`. 
*You better check to see the array is not empty before this ;-)*
