Text: Hello, I’m new in PHP and Kirby (great software!).
I want to create a counter of pages style of “page (number) of (totalpages)”, I don't know if `$pages->pagination()` could be work, I’d tried and didn't work.

This is my partial solution:

`<?php`
` $projs = $page->siblings()->visible();`
` $i = $n = 0;`
` foreach ($projs as $p) {`
`  $i++;`
`  if($p->isOpen()) {`
`   $n = $i;`
`   break;`
`  }`
` }`
`?>`
`<div class="counter">Project <?php echo $n . 'of' . $projs->count()?></div>`

Is there a short code?
Thanks.
