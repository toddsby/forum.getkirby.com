Text: You can forbid subpages altogether with the pages variable, but is there a simple way to forbid the creation of pages as well?

Basically, I want to allow the panel users to edit and delete existing pages but the creation of new pages should be restricted. 

It might be useful to forbid the deletion of pages as well. 

I think this should easily be doable with two new variables. 

What do you think?
