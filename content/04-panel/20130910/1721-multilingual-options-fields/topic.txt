Text: Hello!

I would like to know if there is a way in the panel of Kirby to create multilingual fields for predefined options fields like
* Radio
* Checkbox
* Multicheckbox
* Select

Here is an exemple: if I have a Multicheckbox with those options:
* Print
* Web sites
* Motion

I would like to have a french language equivalent like thoses:
* Imprim√©
* Sites internet
* Animation

thank you,
Catherine
