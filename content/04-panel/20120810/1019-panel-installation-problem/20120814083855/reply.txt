Text: Checked again. My previous (working - means I got the panel) installation had this htaccess in the kirby-root:

	# Kirby .htaccess
	
	# enable php for directory indexes. 
	# this should be enabled by default, but let's just make sure
	DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm
	
	# rewrite rules
	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	
	# enable awesome urls. i.e.: 
	# http://yourdomain.com/about-us/team
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	
	# make sure to set the RewriteBase correctly
	# if you are running the site in a subfolder.
	# Otherwise links will break.
	# 
	# If your homepage is http://yourdomain.com/mysite
	# Set the RewriteBase to:
	# 
	# RewriteBase /mysite
	# 
	RewriteBase /vedam.first
	
	# redirect everything to index.php
	RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]
	 
	</IfModule>
	
	# Additional values
	AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

and in addition this htaccess in the panel-folder:

	DirectoryIndex index.htm index.php
	
	# rewrite rules
	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	
	RewriteEngine on
	#RewriteBase /panel
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]
	 
	</IfModule>

Hmm.
