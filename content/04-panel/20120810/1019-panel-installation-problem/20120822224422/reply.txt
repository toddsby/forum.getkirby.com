Text: Was this ever resolved. I think I'm having a similar problem.

Panel was working fine until I realised that all the url's on the main kirby install were broken because I was in a subfolder. I updated the config.php file and the .htaccess file. Then the links in the kirby install were fine but I can't get access to the panel.

Is there a chance I'm doing something terribly wrong or does Kirby Panel not yet support being installed in a subfolder.

Thanks
