Text: Slightly different issue here, I think, but for posterity:

Login wasn't working for me when I used either of the "encrypt" lines in my account file. It worked without encryption.

I had a couple of special characters, i.e., ^ ) #, in the password.

When I removed them and used just alpha-numerical chars in pw, it then started working with encryption turned on.
