Text: I've a strange problem accessing the kirby panel. 
Every time I try to login the login page appears again. 
If i enter my correct username/password the loginbutton is/stays blue.  If I enter false ones the button becomes red. 
So the auth itself should work. 
But i can't access the panel (index) page. I can only access the login page.  I also tried to reinstall it - same result. 
I've the newest .htaccess file and the file permission of content folder is also correct. 

Any others ideas what could be wrong?
