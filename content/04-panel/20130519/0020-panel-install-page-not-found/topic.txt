Text: Hey Guys, 

Just tried installing the panel and after setting up my blueprints (which I presume are correct) anytime I try and click on a page to edit, I get a "Page Not Found" error. I have a feeling it's a ReWrite issue, but I have all of the htaccess configurations set up. 

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
