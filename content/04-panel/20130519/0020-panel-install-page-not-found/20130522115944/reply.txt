Text: Your `.htaccess` file be more like (link:https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/blob/master/.htaccess text:this popup:yes).

If you install (link:https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms text:current version popup:yes), your issue might be an FTP permissions problem (link:/docs/panel/troubleshooting/permissions).

If your Kirby installation is on primary domain you canâ€™t install Panel in a subdomain.
