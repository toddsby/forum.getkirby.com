Text: If on a Mac you will also want 777 for permissions on content and sub folders of it with the default Apache server.

Assuming Mac and Apache, I'd leave everything as default and set up Apache virtual hosts (**httpd-vhosts.conf**) for sub folders, it's so much nicer ;-)

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin fred@domain.tld
    DocumentRoot "/Users/fred/Sites/sitefolder/"
    ServerName sitefolder.dev
    ServerAlias www.sitefolder.dev
	<Directory DocumentRoot>
	    AllowOverride All
	    Order allow,deny
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>
    ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/folder.dev-error_log"
    CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/folder.dev-access_log" common
</VirtualHost>
```

Don't forget to change your hosts and restart Apache server and make sure it is running OK.
