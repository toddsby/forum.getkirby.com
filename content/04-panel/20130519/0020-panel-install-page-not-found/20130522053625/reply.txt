Text: Sorry about that. Here's the answers to your questions:

1. No, even with the default blueprint, I still can't edit a page.
2. Yes, I have the main panel folder in the site root and the secondary panel folder (as per the installation instructions) in "site". 
3. I've added in all of my blueprints (I believe they're correct)
4. The .htaccess has the following:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>


Thanks for the help ;-)
