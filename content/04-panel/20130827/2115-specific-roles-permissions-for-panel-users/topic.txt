Text: Hello Everybody,

I was curious if anyone has experimented with, or accomplished, creating separate roles/permissions for each panel user. For example, user "JaneDoe" could have access to edit and create ANY page within the panel while user "JohnDoe" could only "see" and edit three pages.

Let me know what you all think. And thanks!
