Text: Hello,

Sorry i posted this in the  general forum but here its better.

Kirby is very cool! ;)

I want to create a page that can contain two fields with each several images.
For example:
All the product pages must have two parts.
A part with Items images and a part with Components images.
I want that a default product page has two fields that can be filled in with several images.
Is it possible or not? and how? :)

Thank you.
