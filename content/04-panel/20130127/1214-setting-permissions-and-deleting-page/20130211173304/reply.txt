I ran into the same problem as Grimmweb, and solved it thanks to you.
But, curious as I am, I don't understand why it has anything to do with Mac OS. My site is hosted by an ISP and I don't think they run their servers on a Mac, in fact I'm pretty sure they use a lot of Linux and Windows servers.
So the permissions to be set are pretty general I think/thought. How come that 0755 has to be 777 when you configure them on a Mac.
