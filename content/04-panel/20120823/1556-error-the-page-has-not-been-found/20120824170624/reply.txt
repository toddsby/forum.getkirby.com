Text: Hey Dennis, 

you can try three things: 

1. make sure that the RewriteBase is set to /test in your htaccess file
2. make sure you don't set url or subfolder in your config file. both should be set to false
3. if the steps above won't work, try to get the latest dev version of kirby and the panel from github:
