Text: @quintincarlson did you make sure that URL rewriting with mod_rewrite is available? If you are on a dv I suppose that you are responsible for server administration, right? You might need to change your apache config to allow htaccess files to work and also to enable mod_rewrite. 

Alternatively you can go to site/config/config.php and set 

```php
c::set('rewrite', false);
```
