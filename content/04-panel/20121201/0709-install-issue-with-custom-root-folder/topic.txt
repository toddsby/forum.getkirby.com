Text: Hello all, I have the panel installed and it loads but all of the pages that it shows within my site are being link as if they where inside the panel folder.

http://localhost/panel/page instead of http://localhost/page

All of my site files are moved to a "core" folder with content in the base folder.

Do I need to change the $root = dirname(dirname(__FILE__));
