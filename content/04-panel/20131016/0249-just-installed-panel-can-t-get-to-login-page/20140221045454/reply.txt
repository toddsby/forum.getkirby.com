Panel installation - Stuck on accounts (step 2)

Found this post, by @dokdeleon
maybe try this: c::set('troubleshoot', true); on line 301 of your http://yoursite.com/site/config/config.php. Go to your home page and you should be able to see your setup and if there's an error, it should show up here.

Great way to see what's wrong. I'd never seen this before. Great way to see what's incorrectly set up.
