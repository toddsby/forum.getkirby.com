Text: Hi all,

I've been creating a site which has an events calendar in it.
To do this I've simply created a content folder for Events, inside are event(s) folders for each event.

The issue I have is that I've got a few recurring events and I'm getting a conflict with not being able to give something the same name twice. 

I.E, I have an event called "This Event" and I need multiple instances of a page called "This Event". I've installed panel and that stops me from creating the page using a title that already exists, but I can of course create them at folder level only if you do this it ignores it.

Does anyone have a suggestion of how I may approach this differently?
