Text: hi,

i installed on my hosting kirby and the panel.
did not have to set anything in the .htaccess file, kirby worked well.
the panel works, but either click on the link, "The page has not been found" error page thrown.
content folder: chmod 755.

what could be the problem?

thanks for your help!
