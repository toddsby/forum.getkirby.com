Text: @russbaldwin I have changed the subfolder to `test`, and I did copy the `defaults` folder from `kirbycms-panel` to Kirby's `site` folder. I cannot change the `kirbycms-panel` to just `panel` â€“ the page where the panel is supposed to be throws up a warning / fatal error message.

Tried locally (MAMP) and I cannot get links to work in Panel either :(
