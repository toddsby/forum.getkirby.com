Text: I was also having this issue. @RachelTai_ 's fix worked but with a small tweak. The panel package download was in a folder called "kirbycms-panel-master" so the update to .htaccess I made is:

<code>RewriteRule ^kirbycms-panel-master/(.*) kirbycms-panel-master/index.php [L]</code>

I can now edit the site details and each page.
