Text: I just tried using Kirby without a **.htaccess** file and in **config.php** changed rewrite to false.

```php
c::set('rewrite', false);
```
Opened Panel edited a file and saved and I was surprised, but it did work.

404 Error sounds like routing problems, are you sure there are no .htaccess  affecting things from a parent directory?
