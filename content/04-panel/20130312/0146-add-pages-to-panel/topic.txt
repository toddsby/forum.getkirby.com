I'm putting together a style manual and basic how to for clients that i'd like to implement as a page in the panel with a hard coded link possible left aligned from the sort button. It would be a static page like the index with the site info (although no need to be able to edit). Has anyone done this yet? Any ideas or help would be awesome.
