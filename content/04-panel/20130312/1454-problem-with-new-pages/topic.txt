Text: I could use some help with the following Problem: 

When I try to create some pages in the panel, I get this error-msg: "Data could not be saved" above the input-field, but the new page is created in the panel anyways. Though the Directory is not created.

I set the file-permissions to 777 and checked the config and .htaccess settings... Kirby troubleshooting-page shows no error.

HereÂ´s a Screenshot: (link: http://www.imagesocket.com/photos/guest/2587514)

Any Ideas?

Thx, Manuel
