Text: I've just updated my files to include these following buttons:

- h4
- h5
- h6
- ul
- ol
- hr
- blockquote
- code
- youtube
- vimeo
- image

You can get an updated /panel/assets/js/panel.js here:
<http://pastebin.com/8yjx6Vmy>

You can get the new language entries /panel/languages/en.php here (merge with your current language file):
<http://pastebin.com/Tta6uKxC>

You can get an updated /panel/snippets/form.overlays.php here:
<http://pastebin.com/XK2VdvTu>

You can get an updated /panel/lib/form.php here:
<http://pastebin.com/AjYzNv7r>

Put all those new files in its respective folder and now you can simply add them in your blueprints using the names in the list above.

Be warned that it is not perfect as I encountered limitations with the current panel. If someone updated it or has a better way to do some options, please let me know.
