Text: Hi,
the server is a remote webserver, run by nearlyfreespeech.net.
I can create files manually outside the panel, with the owner being the ftp-user.
The rights of the folders and files are 777, so anyone can access it.
The owner is as well the ftp-user logging in on the server. I used Transmit to upload and change the access rights.

I'm really not sure what else i can do...

The weird thing is, the panel creates an empty folder when i try to create a new page. This empty folder i can delete via the panel.
So this doesn't seem to affect folders, only files.

Update: Now i am guessing, that the panel can create a folder (which has access rights 755), but can't write into the folder. Which is still weird enough...
