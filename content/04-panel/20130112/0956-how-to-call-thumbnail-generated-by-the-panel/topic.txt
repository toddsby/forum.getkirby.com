Text: Just starting to dig into Kirby - fantastic so far! I'm having a bit of an issue trying to use the auto thumbnail generation that's built into the Panel, though.

If I were using the thumbnail *plugin*, I'd so this:

    <?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 160, 'crop' => true)); ?>

Of course, this causes an error because the `thumb()` function does not exist!

So, I'm wondering how to:

1. Set specific sizes with the auto thumbnail generator.
2. Call specific thumbnail sizes in my templates

Thanks!
