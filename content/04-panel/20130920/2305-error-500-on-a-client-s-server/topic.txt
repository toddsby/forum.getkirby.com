Text: I just transferred a working Kirby installation to a new client server. It's a shared hosting installation, with some rigid security rules (no php_flags declaration in the .htaccess, for example).

The kirby-powered website works quite well, but the panel doesn't work, and I get a nice Error 500.

I don't have access to an error log, so I don't know where it comes from. Does anyone know from what part of the code the error could come ? I suspect it might be because of the upload class (the host FAQ doesn't say anything of value on the limits on php functions and chmod).

I'm at loss as to how to make it workâ€¦
