Text: Hi,

thank you very much. Subdirectories are set in .htaccess, but I played a little bit around with my .htaccess file and that did the trick: i was using the .htaccess distributed with monochrome theme and some options in there seem to prevent the panel from saving. I didnt have a closer look yet, but with the normal .htaccess from the kirby master everything works fine.

will let you know if i find out more.
