Text: Hi, 

I just started playing around with Kirby, and I am having problems with folder and file permissions in the content folder when using the **Panel** (but only with my local AMP stack on OSX Mavericks installed with **Homebrew**, on my shared host on uberspace.de everything works fine):

> The permissions in your content directory are not set properly. Please change the permissions for all folders to **0755** and for all files to **0666**

What I figured out already is, that this is not a Kirby problem per se. The permissions are set how they're supposed to, but PHP has no write access when run with apache, I checked it by echoing it out in the **check::all** function of the Panel's lib, so this is working as it should.

but when I run **is_writable** in the interactive php shell with **php -a** I get this.

	php > echo is_writable("./content/") ? "writable" : "not writable";
	# outputs "is writable"


So php can access the dir and files but not when run with apache, so this might be more of an apache or *nix group permission question. I am not an expert with this, but I guess is has something to do that apache is not a member of the right group?

Or maybe the local folders in my http root are not in the right group or not owned by apache?

Thanks in advance.
