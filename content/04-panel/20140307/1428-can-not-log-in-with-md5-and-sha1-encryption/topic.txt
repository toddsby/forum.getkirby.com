Text: I can not log in users that has md5 or sha1 encryption enabled.

Login to panel without encryption works.

For testing purposes I use the exact name and password as outlined in the tutorial here on this site.

I have the same issues on a local installation with Mamp as well as on an external server.

Any ideas of what I could try to get this to work?

Thanks.
