Text: Hi all,

I'm building a documentation manager with Kirby and I'd like to make something like a **revision system**, committing every save on a git repository.

Is there a way to attach an action to the *save* function without hacking the code? 
Does The panel have some **callback functionality** I'm not aware of?
