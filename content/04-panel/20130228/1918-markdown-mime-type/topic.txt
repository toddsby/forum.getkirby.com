Text: Hello,

I know that it is possible to add mime types to the Kirby Panel in its config file. But I'm not familiar with such things and I really don't know what to use for Markdown files. I'm using .md files in Kirby and I'd like to upload .md containing media meta info.

Some people say it's text/x-web-markdown or text/x-markdown but it still doesn't work.

Any idea?

Thanks,
Thibaut
