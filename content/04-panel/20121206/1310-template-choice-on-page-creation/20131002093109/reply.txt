Text: If I have an 'articles' templates and then an 'article' template for individual articles, I would have set it on the 'articles' templates.
Something like:

```html
title: Add an Article
files: false
pages:
  template: article
fields:
  title: 
    label: Title
    type:  text
  description: 
    label: Description
    type:  text

```

Hope this helps, it can be a bit confusing :-)
