Text: Sorry to bring this old thread back to life but I'm having issues with this as well.

I'm using the latest dev branches of both Kirby and the Panel.

I have to templates and blueprints, members.php and member.php.

I'm trying to set that each new page created under members.php can only use member.php as a template.

To do this I've done this in members.php:
``
title: Medlemmar
pages: true
template: member
``

But when I try to create a new subpage for Members, which will be Member, I can choose whatever template I want.
