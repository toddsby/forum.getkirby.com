Text: Hey there,

I read [on your blog](http://getkirby.com/blog/frontend-authentication) about frontend authentication. But it doesnt seem to be usable for my question.

# Problem
I would like to have 2 user accounts (that can login to panel):

    - superadmin
    - editor

superadmin should see the whole backend, editor only the ones I allow him to see. He should also be able to edit some of those files he sees. This is not possible at the moment, am I right?


#Suggestion

I suggest to solve that by writing a "rights"-number into the account file:

    username: editor
    password: yourpassword
    rights: 2

Rights could be as easy as:
>0 - hidden
>1 - see/read
>2 - write/create
>3 - edit/update
>4 - delete/move
>5 - all rights

So lets say I have the structure

    - home
    - blog
     - entry 1
     - entry 2
    - contact

superadmin should see it all (like it is now), editor should only **see** the blog and only **edit**/create the subpages of the blog.

Suggest a blueprint like that:

    title: blog
    pages: true
    rights: 1

    title: blogentry
    pages: false
    rights: 4



What do you think? Is this possible yet? Will something like that be implemented? What love to see this happen :)
