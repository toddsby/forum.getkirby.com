Text: I was trying to figure this out, and didn't see your question earlier. This is exactly what I did. I made the blueprint a text field.

As long as the field is called "date", kirby still treats it as a date on the backend so you can use any PHP date formatting functions. If you call the field something else (like I had to do with events, because I have beginning and ending dates) you'll have to use the php strtotime function to convert it to a date, and then format it using the php date function.
