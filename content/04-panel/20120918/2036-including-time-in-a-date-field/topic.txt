Text: Is it possible to modify the date field to include a time? I'd like to add the time purely for the RSS field, because I've found that weird things happen with feed readers if only the date is included.

What I'd like to use is something like `dd.mm.yy HH:II`, but I couldn't seem to do this when using the date field type in the blueprint and hence the jQuery datepicker. Would the best workaround be to use a textfield for that blueprint field and just enter the date/time manually?

By the way, I LOVE Kirby. I've just set up a site to replace my use of Tumblr and it amazes and delights me at every turn ;-)
