Text: Hey guys,

Newbie here and I might just be a dope and missing something obvious, but after installing the panel and all seems to be working fine, I can't work out how to get the text formatting buttons to display on the edit page. Do I need to do something in the code, or am I missing something??

Thanks,
Dave
