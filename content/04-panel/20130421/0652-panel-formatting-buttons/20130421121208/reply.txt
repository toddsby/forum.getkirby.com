Text: Okay, worked out both the above, but a new problem has arisen...

So showing buttons I found out how from: http://getkirby.com/blog/panel-0-6

But now I get an error message at the top of my edit screen:

Notice: Undefined variable: css in /public_html/kirby/panel/lib/form.php on line 160

Warning: implode() [function.implode]: Invalid arguments passed in /public_html/kirby/panel/lib/form.php on line 160
