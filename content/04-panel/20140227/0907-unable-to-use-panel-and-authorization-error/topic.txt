Text: I am able to log into and use the panel on a kirby site that I am developing, but a partner of mine using a different computer is unable to. Using Safari, he is unable even to log in; using Chrome, he is able to log in, but when he attempts to add a project the sidebar grays out and nothing further happens. 

In the sites error log, there is the following: 

> [error]  user **** not found: /failed_auth.html    
> [error]  user **** not found: /panel/

Does any one know what might be going on here. I'm stumped.
