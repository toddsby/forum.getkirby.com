Text: I want to use my own thumbnails using the 01.thumb.jpg method so that I can access them via PHP - but the Kirby Panel seems to have no way of letting you upload them.

When I try and upload the above file - it renames it to 01-thumb.jpg and obviously treats it as a regular image, not a thumbnail. 

If I upload manually (drop the thumbnail file into the folder, rather than via the panel) it works fine, except the thumbnail won't show up in the Panel 'files' manager.

I'm aware that Kirby Panel auto generates thumbnails now ... but I don't want to use these for a variety of reasons. 

Is there any way to turn this off and allow for uploading my own thumbnails via the Panel?
