Text: Hey,

I have weird problem with kirby panel, when creating new pages nothing happen, sidebar is just greyed out and url is /panel/quotes/show:content/do:add-page.

I have tried changing config and htaccess settings and setting permissions to 755 or 777 but nothing helps.

Do you have any ideas what might be wrong ? Thanks.
