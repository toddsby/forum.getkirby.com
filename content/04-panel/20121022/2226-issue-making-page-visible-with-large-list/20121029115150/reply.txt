Text: It's really a problem to use the panel with so many articles. I'm thinking about offering an entirely new view for sections with so many subfolders â€“ maybe with a table for articles instead. But for now the hint by @roman_oroco is definitely the way to go. The syntax is just wrong:

  limit: 10
fields:

````
