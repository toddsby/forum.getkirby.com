Text: I've transferred a local dev site to a remote server. I've placed the site in a subfolder and put up a firewall with the Authentication plugin. Everything works just fine.

Meanwhile I worked on the panel and uploaded the necessary files, but trying to log into the Panel fails: after filling in user and password and hitting the submit button doesn't do anything but reset the login form. In my local MAMP set up I'm able to login though.

I've double checked all the files and folders.
Any suggestions?
Thanks
