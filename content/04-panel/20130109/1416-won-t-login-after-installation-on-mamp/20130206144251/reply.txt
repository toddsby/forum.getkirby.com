Text: About your problem: don't leave username like «admin», password like «adminpassword» and rename default account file to other.

I have problem on next step: I got login page and cannot log in. After submit I always back to login page.

MacOS 10.6, MAMP Pro, PHP5.4.4
Fresh Kirby and Panel installed on local address http://kirby.dev

Any ideas?

**Update**: My fault. Name of account file and username in this file must be similar!
