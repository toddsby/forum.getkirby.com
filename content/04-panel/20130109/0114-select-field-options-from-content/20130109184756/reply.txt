Text: If I understand correctly, you can set up a blueprint with a "tags" field type, and that will give you a field that auto-completes based on the same field in sibling articles. Like this:

    categories:
        label: Categories
        type: tags
        index: siblings

It wan't give you a select list, but it will let you start typing and then auto-complete.
