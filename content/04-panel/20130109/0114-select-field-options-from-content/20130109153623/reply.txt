Text: Yes I understand, thanks for your answer. 
But what if I want to manage clients and projects in a personal website, and i want to assign projects to clients?
Everytime I add a new client (with all its felds, let's say name, contacts, etc.) I have to add it to the blueprint, right? 
So i have to add it two times (one time as article, one as blueprint options).
I'm just experimenting with Kirby (that I find great!) but maybe it's not the right solution in this case.
Thanks
