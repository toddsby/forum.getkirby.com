Text: I think I'm missing something very simple, but I'm not seeing how to create a new file from the Panel that is a subdirectory of a top-level Kirby page.

So I have in my Content folder, a structure like:

- 01-home
- 02-food
- events
    -01-event1
    -02-event2
    -03-event3
- error

When I create a new file in panel it puts it at the main level with "home", "food", etc.

Most of the new files I want to create will be events so I want them to be within the "events" folder. What triggers this? Is this something in how I've set up my blueprints?
