Ahh okay, sorry.

I've got the following blueprint for my page (blogarticle):

	title: Blog-Artikel
	pages: false
	files: true
	fields:
		title:
			label: Titel
			type: text
		date:
			label: Datum
			type: text
		tags:
			label: Tags
			type: text
		text:
			label: Text
			type: textarea
			size: large

Normally the URL is created from the title (http://domain.com/blog/ {title}). I would like to put the tags with the URL (ex. http://domain.com/blog/{tags}-{title}).

At the moment i do it by hand, but I want the panel to do this job for me. Is there some PHP-magix that can do this?

Cheers
