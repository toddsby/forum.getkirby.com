Text: Hi Forum,

I posted this in the general forum, but though it would a good idea to post here too as it is a panel related issue.

I am running a multi language site with Kirby. All pages are in English and in Dutch, on page is in English, Dutch and French, the blog is in English.

I would like to know if it's possible to prevent the panel from auto-creating the .lang.txt files to make sure there is a prober fallback when no translation is given?

Currently Kirby falls back to the default language when a text file for another language is missing. But since the Panel creates the files automatically, I end up with empty text fields for non-translated content.

Thanks for any suggestions!
