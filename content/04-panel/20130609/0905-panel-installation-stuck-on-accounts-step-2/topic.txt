Text: What is the expected behavior of clicking the Login button on the step 2 page?
--- --- ---
I've installed the panel and double-checked permissions and .htaccess (the latter clearly shows the panel rule entries), but when I click Login, the same page refreshes.  Certainly that's not correct?

There don't seem to be console errors, but the onclick event handler, 'window.location.reload' is puzzling. It seems like that is exactly what is happening.

Any hints?
