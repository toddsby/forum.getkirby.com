Text: @netaisllc, hi. You should be able to see a login box once you've completed (and followed closely) the instructions from the page. 

Just a few checklist, see if these are done:

- The kirby panel folder (previously named **kirbycms-panel**) you added in the root of your site, were you able to rename it to **panel**? 
- Were you able to *copy* the **default** folder inside the kirby panel folder and pasted it inside `http://yoursite.com/site` and renamed it to **panel**? 
- Did you change the file under `http://yoursite.com/site/panel/accounts/` to have your login details? And were you able to change its filename to your username?

If after these, you're still in the same **step 2** page, then you might want to consider retracing your steps when you first installed kirby. :D
