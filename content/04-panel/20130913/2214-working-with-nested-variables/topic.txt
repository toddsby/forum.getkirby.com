Text: I am trying to configure the panel to work with a new site and I am having trouble setting up a blueprint for a file with nested variables. Following is an example strucure:

Questions:

question-1:
  Text: this is a question
  Phase: 1
  Description: this is a description for question 1

question-2:
  Text: this is a question
  Phase: 2
  Description: this is a description for question 1

----

Methods:

method-1:
  Text: this is a method
  Phase: 1
  Description: this is a description for method 1

method-2:
  Text: this is a method
  Phase: 1
  Description: this is a description for method 2



The problem I am having is that I am unable to get the nested variables to display correctly in kirby panel. Anyone know of perhaps it is not set up to deal with nested variables in this way?
