Text: I may be being a bit silly but is it possible to create a custom blueprint that can apply to say 2 out 4 pages within the panel?

For example I have these pages...

Home
About The Company
Whats Our Aim
Projects

And these blueprints...

default.php
content.php
projects.php

I would like the content.php blueprint to apply to both About The Company & Whats Our Aim pages, is this possible?
