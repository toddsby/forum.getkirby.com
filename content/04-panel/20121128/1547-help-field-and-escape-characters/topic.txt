Text: I would like to add a field for adding Vimeo or YouTube links. Since I don't know beforehand if it will be a Vimeo or YouTube link I thought about adding a simple text field and have the user input the Kirbytext for the link (e.g. `(vimeo: URL width: 960 height: 540)`.

So far so good. To make the entry simpler I wanted to add a help definition to that field and enter the above syntax, so the user can basically copy & paste and replace the URL. Like this:

	video:
		label: Video
		type: text
		help: Example: ([vimeo: URL width: 960 height: 540])

Unfortunately, the Panel seems to break when I enter a string that gets interpreted as Kirbytext as help text. Does that make sense? Is there a way to do this?
