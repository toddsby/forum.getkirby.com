Text: Hi, you have two questions there. I can only answer the first one. 

Note that the solution is a hack and you should expect it to disappear if you update the panel. I'm still testing this, so can't guarantee that it doesn't break anything else.
Maybe Bastian has a better solution that doesn't require messing with the internals, as it would be a nice feature. Maybe this is addressed in the new Panel?

Anyway my solution was this.

1. Rename your template files so they can be isolated.
For example, if you have a template called post.txt rename it to panel.post.txt.
Do this in your content folders, template folder and blueprint folder.

2. There is a function called findTemplates in 'panel/lib/data.php'. 
This function builds an array of templates. I modified this function so that it only returned templates that contain the string 'panel' in the filename:
_if (strpos($name, 'panel') !== false)
{
    // add it to the list of templates
    $templates[] = $name; 
}_
As far as I can see this function is only used in one place ...

3. Open up 'pages.add.php' in 'panel/snippets'.
The top of this file contains the call to 'data::findTemplates'. 
This is where the templates are called from. You don't need to do anything here, but it's good to know where the template list gets rendered.

Hope that helps.
(If anyone else has a different/better way of doing this, shout!)
