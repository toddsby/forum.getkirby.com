Text: Hi,

First of all, thank you *SO MUCH* for the hassle-free experience of Kirby! I'm having a blast using it!

I've installed the panel, and got rid of the various warnings I had (i.e. setting folders to 755 and adding blueprints for the different pages) but now that this is done, I'm having trouble with the panel itself: I can't seen to be able to edit anything.

For example: if I click on the 'Articles' page on the sidebar on the left, it's going to take me to http://tibz.co/panel/articles as opposed to http://tibz.co/articles and show up the error page.

I've looked around the forum for similar problems, but the solutions given didn't seem to have had an impact.

Any clues as to why this is happening and how to fix it?

Thanks :)
Thibault
