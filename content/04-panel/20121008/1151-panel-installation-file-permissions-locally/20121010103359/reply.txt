Text: Strange stuff! What the panel normally does is to go through all files and check if PHP has write permissions. So it might be that there are just a few missing files somewhere, which are still not writable.

But I just added a way to switch off that message in your config. Get the latest developer version: 

<http://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/tree/dev>

and go to `site/panel/config/config.php` to set: 

```php

c::set('panel.check', false);

```
