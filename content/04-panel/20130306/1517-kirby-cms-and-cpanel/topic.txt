Text: Hi,
I sort of have a newbie question. I have a domain with a cpanel backend. Now getting there with a usual website, you would type 'yourdomain.com/cpanel'. I would like to know how to upload my Kirby website on Cpanel and also what to type on the address bar to get to the Kirby panel. Thank you.
