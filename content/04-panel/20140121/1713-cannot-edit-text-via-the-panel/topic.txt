Text: Hi there!

So I have been setting up Kirby for the past few hours. I got past the issues with permissions etc. and got rid of the errors telling me  the permissions were set incorrectly and there was no thumbs directory.
Anyhow, now it seems as if I can edit my pages' titles, but not the text.
All options, like title or the info on the home.txt, are showing, except the text option.

Any ideas?

thanks up front! :)
