I am having the following issue: when I try to delete a page using the panel, I get redirected to the following URL
`http://dev.mysite.com/panel/index.php/en/blog/show:pages`

which displays an error message:

`Warning: require(/var/www-dev/panel/templates/pages.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www-dev/panel/lib/panel.php on line 159 Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required '/var/www-dev/panel/templates/pages.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www-dev/panel/lib/panel.php on line 159`

Strange thing is that an exact copy of this website is working OK on my local machine (permissions etc). The only difference is that I use apache locally and lighttpd on remote, but I can't see any problems with this -- rewrite rules are translated and seem to be working properly on both main site and panel. Any thoughts?

I have tried using both stable panel version and the one from dev, same issue re-occurs.


Thanks!
